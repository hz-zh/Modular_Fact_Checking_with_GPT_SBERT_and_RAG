Located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean , the city has served as an important port for millennia . , it has a population of 2,425,000 residents .   Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers . These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland -LRB- 1889 -- 1936 -RRB- in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government -LRB- 2004 -- 2012 -RRB- and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 . Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction .   As Somalia 's capital city , many important national institutions are based in Mogadishu . It is the seat of the Federal Government of Somalia established in August 2012 , with the Somalia Federal Parliament serving as the government 's legislative branch . Thabit Abdi Mohammed has been the Mayor of Mogadishu since April 2017 . Villa Somalia is the official residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia , Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed . In May 2012 , the First Somali Bank was established in the capital , which organized Mogadishu 's first ever Technology , Entertainment , Design -LRB- TEDx -RRB- conference . The establishment of a local construction yard has also galvanized the city 's real-estate sector . Arba'a Rukun Mosque is one of the oldest Islamic places of worship in the capital , built circa 667 -LRB- 1268/9 AD -RRB- . The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity in Mogadishu is the largest masjid in the Horn region . Mogadishu Cathedral was built in 1928 by the colonial authorities in Italian Somaliland in a Norman Gothic style , and served as the traditional seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio . The National Museum of Somalia is based in Mogadishu and holds many culturally important artefacts . The National Library of Somalia is undergoing a $ 1 million Somali federal government funded renovation , including a new library complex .   Mogadishu is home to a number of scholastic and media institutions . As part of the municipality 's urban renewal program , 100 schools across the capital are scheduled to be refurbished and reopened . The Somali National University -LRB- SNU -RRB- was established in the 1950s , and professors from the university later founded the non-governmental Mogadishu University -LRB- MU -RRB- . Benadir University -LRB- BU -RRB- was established in 2002 with the intention of training doctors . Various national sporting bodies have their headquarters in Mogadishu , including the Somali Football Federation and the Somali Olympic Committee . Mogadishu Stadium was constructed in 1978 during the Siad Barre administration , with the assistance of Chinese engineers . It hosts football matches with teams from the Somali First Division and the Somalia Cup . Additionally , the Port of Mogadishu serves as a major national seaport and is the largest harbour in Somalia . Mogadishu International Airport , the capital 's main airport , is the hub of the national carrier Somali Airlines . \"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Mogadishu -LRB- -LSB- ˌmɔːɡəˈdiːʃuː -RSB- Muqdisho -LSB- mʉqdɪʃɔ -RSB- ; مقديشو -LSB- maqadiːʃuː -RSB- -RRB- , known locally as Hamar , is the capital and most populous city of Somalia .'}]\n","messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Extract sentences from the source text that are relevant (either supporting or refuting) to the preceding claim.

He is the lead singer of the British rock band Blur and co-founder , vocalist , instrumentalist and principal songwriter of the virtual band Gorillaz .   Raised in Leytonstone , East London and around Colchester , Essex , Albarn attended the Stanway School , where he met Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur , whose debut album Leisure was released in 1991 to mixed reviews . After spending long periods of time touring the US , Albarn 's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s . The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , Parklife -LRB- 1994 -RRB- and The Great Escape -LRB- 1995 -RRB- . All three albums received critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK , aided by a Britpop rivalry with Oasis . Subsequent albums such as Blur -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , 13 -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , Think Tank -LRB- 2003 -RRB- and The Magic Whip -LRB- 2015 -RRB- contained influences from lo-fi , electronic and hip hop music .   Along with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett , Albarn formed the `` virtual band '' Gorillaz in 1998 . Drawing influences from alternative rock , trip hop , hip hop , electronica , dub , reggae and pop music , the band released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success . Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor , the albums feature collaborations from a wide range of artists . Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the `` Most Successful Virtual Band '' .

It was released as the lead single from the record on August 10 , 2013 . Perry co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its producers Dr. Luke , Max Martin , and Cirkut . It is a pop song containing elements of arena rock and lyrics centering on standing up for oneself and self-empowerment .   Some critics praised the track 's production while others felt that its lyrics contained `` clichés '' . The song was a commercial success , becoming Perry 's eighth non-consecutive number one song on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 , and also topping charts in Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom . It also reached the top five in most international charts , including France , Germany , Italy , Japan , and Switzerland .   To promote the song , Perry performed under the Brooklyn Bridge at the closing ceremony of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , on The X Factor Australia , at the Sydney Opera House in late October 2013 , and on the German TV show Schlag den Raab . Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi directed the song 's music video , which features Perry trying to adapt to the jungle where she survived a plane crash , and taming a tiger . It garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics . `` Roar '' was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards . The song topped the charts in 14 countries and , by the end of 2013 , sold 9.9 million units -LRB- combined sales and track-equivalent streams -RRB- globally according to the IFPI . `` Roar '' has sold 6.4 million copies in the US , over 1 million in the UK . \"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"`` Roar '' is a song by American singer Katy Perry for her fourth studio album , Prism -LRB- 2013 -RRB- .\"}]\n","messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Extract sentences from the source text that are relevant (either supporting or refuting) to the preceding claim.

The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , there are also cortical areas associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , a motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with a particular side of the brain , such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts known as commisures , the largest being the corpus callosum .   The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts known as peduncles . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system of the brain , which consists of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .   The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets . These connections form various neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry of the brain is driven by the process of neurotransmission .   The brain is protected by the skull , suspended in cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood -- brain barrier . However , the brain is still susceptible to damage , disease , and infection . Damage can be caused by trauma , or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke . The brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , forms of dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , and multiple sclerosis . A number of psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia and clinical depression , are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions , although the nature of these is not well understood . The brain can also be the site of tumours , both benign and malignant . Malignant tumours mostly originate from sites outside the brain .   The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy , while the study of its function is neuroscience . A number of different techniques are used to study the brain . Brain specimens from other animals , which may be examined microscopically , have been a traditional source of much information . Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography -LRB- EEG -RRB- recordings are important techniques in studying the brain . Examining the medical history of people with brain injury has also provided great insight into the function of each part of the brain . \"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .'}]\n","messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Extract sentences from the source text that are relevant (either supporting or refuting) to the preceding claim.

Dalai Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school , the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism which is nominally headed by the Ganden Tripas . From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to 1959 , the central government of Tibet , the Ganden Phodrang , invested the position of Dalai Lama with temporal duties .   The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser village , Amdo , Tibet -LRB- was administratively in Qinghai province , Republic of China -RRB- , and was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama at a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939 . His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 , and he eventually assumed full temporal -LRB- political -RRB- duties on 17 November 1950 , at the age of 15 , after the People 's Republic of China 's invasion of Tibet . The Gelug school 's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the Tibet Autonomous Region just as the nascent PRC wished to assert central control over it .   During the 1959 Tibetan uprising , the Dalai Lama fled to India , where he currently lives as a refugee . The 14th Dalai Lama received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 . He has traveled the world and has spoken about the welfare of Tibetans , environment , economics , women 's rights , non-violence , interfaith dialogue , physics , astronomy , Buddhism and science , cognitive neuroscience , reproductive health , and sexuality , along with various Mahayana and Vajrayana topics . \"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'During the 1959 Tibetan uprising , the Dalai Lama fled to India , where he currently lives as a refugee .'}]\n","messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Extract sentences from the source text that are relevant (either supporting or refuting) to the preceding claim.

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper . \"}, {'role': 'assistant',
