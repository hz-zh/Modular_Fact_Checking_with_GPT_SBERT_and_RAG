The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams , guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro .   The group released its debut album All We Know Is Falling in 2005 , with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on Billboards Heatseekers Chart . While it only had a minimal commercial performance initially , the album and its lead single `` Pressure '' were eventually certified Gold by the RIAA after the success of the band 's later material .   The band 's second album , Riot ! , was released in 2007 . Due to the success of the singles `` Misery Business '' , `` Crushcrushcrush '' , and `` That 's What You Get '' , Riot ! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in the United States . They then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards . Their 2009 follow-up , Brand New Eyes , is the band 's second-highest charting album to date , landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first week sales . It produced the top-forty single `` The Only Exception '' and went platinum in Ireland and the UK , as well as gold in the US , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand .   Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010 , the band released their self-titled fourth album in 2013 . It gave the band their first career number one on the US Billboard 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom , Ireland , Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , Argentina and Mexico . It included the singles `` Still Into You '' and `` Ai n't It Fun '' , with the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Hayley Williams and Taylor York as songwriters , making it Paramore 's first Grammy win . The band 's lineup changed once again after this album cycle with bassist Jeremy Davis leaving the band near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in 2017 . Their fifth studio album After Laughter was released later that year . "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin , Tennessee , formed in 2004 ."}]}

It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth . Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth , with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive . Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture ; its astronomical symbol represents the god 's sickle .   Saturn 's interior is probably composed of a core of iron -- nickel and rock ( silicon and oxygen compounds ) . This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen , an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium , and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer . Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere . Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn 's planetary magnetic field , which is weaker than Earth 's , but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn 's larger size . Saturn 's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter 's . The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast , although long-lived features can appear . Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1800 km/h , higher than on Jupiter , but not as high as those on Neptune .   Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust . Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn , of which fifty-three are officially named . This does not include the hundreds of moonlets comprising the rings . Titan , Saturn 's largest moon , and the second-largest in the Solar System , is larger than the planet Mercury , although less massive , and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere .

It was written and produced by Jackson , in collaboration with James `` Jimmy Jam '' Harris III and Terrence `` Terry '' Lewis .

It was filmed in black-and-white to portray the song 's theme of racial harmony .

The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch .

The second son of Francis I , he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis III , Duke of Brittany , in 1536 .   As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father . Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion . He persevered in the Italian Wars against the House of Habsburg and tried to suppress the Protestant Reformation , even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign .   The Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis ( 1559 ) , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics . France failed to change the balance of power in Europe , as Spain remained the sole dominant power , but it did benefit from the division of the holdings of its ruler , Charles V , and from the weakening of the Holy Roman Empire , which Charles also ruled .   Henry suffered an untimely death in a jousting tournament held to celebrate the Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis at the conclusion of the Eighth Italian War . The king 's surgeon , Ambroise Par\u00e9 , was unable to cure the infected wound inflicted by Gabriel de Montgomery , the captain of his Scottish Guard . He was succeeded in turn by three of his sons , whose ineffective reigns helped to spark the French Wars of Religion between Protestants and Catholics .

The film is set in Los Angeles and stars Lindsay Lohan , James Deen , Nolan Funk , Amanda Brooks , and Gus Van Sant . It received a limited release on August 2 , 2013 at the IFC Center in New York City , the Bell Lightbox in Toronto , and on video on demand platforms . \nBret Easton Ellis ( born March 7 , 1964 ) is an American author , screenwriter , and short story writer . His works have been translated into 27 languages . He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack , which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney . He is a self-proclaimed satirist , whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style . Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common , recurring characters .   Though Ellis made his debut at age 21 with the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero ( 1985 ) , a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles , the work he is most known for is his third novel , American Psycho ( 1991 ) . On its release , the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic . Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year . In later years , Ellis ' novels have become increasingly metafictional . Lunar Park ( 2005 ) , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews . Imperial Bedrooms ( 2010 ) , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein .   Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films . Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen , leading to the release of a starkly different film of the same name in 1987 . Mary Harron 's adaptation of American Psycho was released to generally positive reviews in 2000 and went on to achieve cult status . Roger Avary 's 2002 adaptation The Rules of Attraction made modest box office returns but went on to attract a cult following . 2008 's The Informers , based on Ellis 's collection of short stories , was critically panned . Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film The Canyons , an original work .

April 2 ] 1743 -- July 4 , 1826 ) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 . Previously , he was elected the second Vice President of the United States , serving under John Adams from 1797 to 1801 . A proponent of democracy , republicanism , and individual rights motivating American colonists to break from Great Britain and form a new nation , he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level . He was a land owner and farmer .   Jefferson was primarily of English ancestry , born and educated in colonial Virginia . He graduated from the College of William & Mary and briefly practiced law , at times defending slaves seeking their freedom . During the American Revolution , he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration , drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator , and he served as a wartime governor ( 1779 -- 1781 ) . He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785 , and subsequently the nation 's first Secretary of State in 1790 -- 1793 under President George Washington . Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System . With Madison , he anonymously wrote the controversial Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 -- 1799 , which sought to embolden states ' rights in opposition to the national government by nullifying the Alien and Sedition Acts .   As President , Jefferson pursued the nation 's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies . He also organized the Louisiana Purchase , almost doubling the country 's territory . As a result of peace negotiations with France , his administration reduced military forces . He was reelected in 1804 . Jefferson 's second term was beset with difficulties at home , including the trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr . American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act of 1807 , responding to British threats to U.S. shipping . In 1803 , Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized Louisiana Territory , and he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807 .   Jefferson mastered many disciplines , which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics . He was a proven architect in the classical tradition . Jefferson 's keen interest in religion and philosophy earned him the presidency of the American Philosophical Society . He shunned organized religion , but was influenced by both Christianity and deism . He was well versed in linguistics and spoke several languages . He founded the University of Virginia after retiring from public office . He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent and important people throughout his adult life . His only full-length book is Notes on the State of Virginia ( 1785 ) , considered the most important American book published before 1800 .   Jefferson owned several plantations which were worked by hundreds of slaves . Most historians now believe that , after the death of his wife in 1782 , he had a relationship with his slave Sally Hemings and fathered at least one of her children . Historians have lauded Jefferson 's public life , noting his primary authorship of the Declaration of Independence during the Revolutionary War , his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia , and the Louisiana Purchase while he was president . Various modern scholars are more critical of Jefferson 's private life , pointing out the discrepancy between his ownership of slaves and his liberal political principles , for example . Presidential scholars , however , consistently rank Jefferson among the greatest presidents .

The dance incorporates dry sex , wrestling and other forms of frantic movement . This dance is not a traditional dance . It is of recent origin , associated with the 2006 wave of dancehall music . \nDancehall ( also known as `` Bashment '' ) is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s . Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style , which had dominated much of the 1970s . In the mid-1980s , digital instrumentation became more prevalent , changing the sound considerably , with digital dancehall ( or `` ragga '' ) becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms . Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of Jamaican Patois rather than Jamaican standard English and a focus on the track instrumentals ( or `` riddims '' ) .   Dancehall music saw mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s . By the 2010s , dancehall began to heavily influence the work of established Western artists and producers , which has helped to further bring the genre into the Western music mainstream .

With an estimated population of around 15.8 million , it is the most populated state in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n , also known as Guatemala City .   The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved in 1841 .   From the mid to late 19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship .   From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability . As of 2014 , Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the Human Development Index .   Guatemala 's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes a large number of endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica 's designation as a biodiversity hotspot . The country is also known for its rich and distinct culture , which is characterized by a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous influences .

The channel primarily consists of TV series and films geared towards teenagers and young adults -- with some programming skewing towards young women -- in the 14-34 age range , a target demographic designated by the channel as `` becomers '' while some programming featured on Freeform ( primarily consisting of movies ) is secondarily geared towards a family audience . Its programming includes contemporary off-network syndicated reruns and original series , feature films and made-for-TV original movies , and some religious programming .   Since the network was launched in April 1977 , it has undergone various changes to its on-air identity -- having changed its name seven different times , the most of any American television network -- and programming over the course of its history . The network was founded as the CBN Satellite Service , an extension of televangelist Pat Robertson 's Christian Broadcasting Network ; it evolved into a family-focused entertainment network in 1981 , eventually becoming known as The Family Channel by 1990 -- after the network was spun out of CBN into the for-profit International Family Entertainment .   In 1997 , IFE and The Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between News Corporation and Saban Entertainment , resulting in its re-branding as the Fox Family Channel . The new owners sought to re-position the network towards younger viewers as a companion for their popular Fox Kids programming block . After the network began to struggle as a result of their changes , the venture was sold to The Walt Disney Company in May 2001 , in a sale that also included Saban Entertainment ; the channel altered its name to ABC Family six months later on November 10 .

Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .

It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems . These speech industry players include Google , Microsoft , IBM , Baidu , Apple , Amazon , Nuance , SoundHound , IflyTek , CDAC many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning .

Created by the writer-artist team of Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino , the character debuted in Flash Comics # 86 ( August 1947 ) . One of DC 's earliest super-heroines , Black Canary has appeared in many of the company 's flagship team-up titles including Justice Society of America and Justice League of America . Since the late 1960s , the character has been paired with archer superhero The Green Arrow professionally and romantically .   At her Golden Age debut , Black Canary was the alter ego of Dinah Drake and participated in crime-fighting adventures with her love interest ( and eventual husband ) , Gotham City detective Larry Lance . Initially , the character was a hand-to-hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs . Later stories depicted her as a world-class martial artist with a superpower : the `` Canary Cry '' , a high-powered sonic scream which could shatter objects and incapacitate enemies even known to be able to kill Kryptonians such as Superman . When DC Comics adjusted its continuity , Black Canary was established as two separate entities : mother and daughter , Dinah Drake and Dinah Laurel Lance . Stories since the Silver Age have focused on the younger Black Canary , ascribing her superhuman abilities to a genetic mutation she uses as well as her amazing training in martial arts .   Black Canary has been adapted into various media , including direct-to-video animated films , video games , and both live-action and animated television series , featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows Birds of Prey , Justice League Unlimited , Smallville , Batman : The Brave and the Bold , Young Justice and Arrow . The character is ranked the 71st-greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard , and IGN rated her its 81st-greatest all-time comic book hero . She was number 26 on Comics Buyer 's Guide 's `` 100 Sexiest Women in Comics '' list .

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .

In December 1928 , Bhagat Singh and an associate , Shivaram Rajguru , fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer , John Saunders , in Lahore , British India , mistaking Saunders , who was still on probation , for the British police superintendent , James Scott , whom they had intended to assassinate . They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai , by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured , and , two weeks after which , died of a heart attack . Saunders was felled by a single shot from Rajguru , a marksman . He was then shot several times by Singh , the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds . Another associate of Singh , Chandra Shekhar Azad , shot dead an Indian police constable , Chanan Singh , who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled .   After escaping , Singh and his associates , using pseudonyms , publicly owned to avenging Lajpat Rai 's death , putting up prepared posters , which , however , they had altered to show Saunders as their intended target . Singh was thereafter on the run for many months , and no convictions resulted at the time . Surfacing again in April 1929 , he and another associate , Batukeshwar Dutt , exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi . They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below , shouted slogans , and then allowed the authorities to arrest them . The arrest , and the resulting publicity , had the effect of bringing to light Singh 's complicity in the John Saunders case . Awaiting trial , Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike , demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners , and ending in Das 's death from starvation in September 1929 . Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931 , aged 23 .   Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death . Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him , `` Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate , for the moment , the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai , and through him of the nation . He became a symbol ; the act was forgotten , the symbol remained , and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab , and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India , resounded with his name . '' In still later years , Singh , an atheist and socialist in life , won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both Communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists . Although many of Singh 's associates , as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries , were also involved in daring acts , and were either executed or died violent deaths , few came to be lionized in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh .

The band consisted of lead vocalist , lead guitarist , and primary songwriter John Fogerty , his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty , bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford . Their musical style encompassed the roots rock , swamp rock , and blues rock genres . Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins , they played in a Southern rock style , with lyrics about bayous , catfish , the Mississippi River , and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography , as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War . The band performed at 1969 's famed Woodstock Festival .   After four years of chart-topping success , the group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 . Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year , and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control , all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits between the former bandmates . Fogerty 's ongoing disagreements with Saul Zaentz , owner of their label Fantasy Records , created further protracted court battles . As a result , John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving former members at CCR 's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   Creedence Clearwater Revival 's music is still a staple of U.S. radio airplay ; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone .

Built of concrete and sand , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian ( 81 -- 96 ) . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name ( Flavius ) .   The Colosseum could hold , it is estimated , between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators , having an average audience of some 65,000 ; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles ( for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities ) , animal hunts , executions , re-enactments of famous battles , and dramas based on Classical mythology . The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era . It was later reused for such purposes as housing , workshops , quarters for a religious order , a fortress , a quarry , and a Christian shrine .   Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers , the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome . It is one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church , as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit `` Way of the Cross '' procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum .   The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin .   The Colosseum 's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium , often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre . The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty , following the reign of Nero . This name is still used in modern English , but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum . In antiquity , Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum ( with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar ) , but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum ; Vespasian and Titus , builders of the Colosseum , also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) .   The name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby ( the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes ) . This statue was later remodeled by Nero 's successors into the likeness of Helios ( Sol ) or Apollo , the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . Nero 's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors . Despite its pagan links , the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers . It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome .   In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colis\u00e6us , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus ( `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' ) . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus ( as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ) . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre .   The Colossus did eventually fall , possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze . By the year 1000 the name `` Colosseum '' had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre . The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives , situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma .   The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages . In Italy , the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo , and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul ( Romanian ) , le Colis\u00e9e ( French ) , el Coliseo ( Spanish ) and o Coliseu ( Portuguese ) .

Portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston , the character was created by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman , and appeared in each of the show 's 236 episodes during its decade-long run , from its premiere on September 22 , 1994 to its finale on May 6 , 2004 . Introduced in the show 's pilot as a naive runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City , Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled , inexperienced daddy 's girl into a successful businesswoman . During the show 's second season , the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross , with whom she maintains a complicated on-again , off-again relationship throughout the entire series . Together , the characters have a daughter , Emma .   The role of Rachel was originally offered to actresses T\u00e9a Leoni , the producer 's first choice , and Courteney Cox , both of whom declined , Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth , and Cox in favor of playing Rachel 's best friend Monica in Friends . A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms , Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live . After acquiring the role and before Friends aired , Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom , Muddling Through , at the time , which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends .   Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout Friends decade-long run , with The A.V. Club attributing much of the show 's early success to the character . However , some of her storylines have been criticized , specifically her romantic relationship with her friend Joey during season ten . Rachel 's popularity established her as the show 's breakout character , who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all-time , while the character 's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own . Named the `` Rachel '' after her , the character 's shag continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history , in spite of Aniston 's own resentment towards it . Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s . Meanwhile , the character 's relationship with Ross is often cited among television 's most beloved .   Rachel is considered to be Aniston 's breakout role , credited with making her the show 's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career . Praised for her performance as Rachel , Aniston won both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series -- Comedy Or Musical .

It is the sequel to 1982 's Blade Runner and stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford , who is reprising his role as Rick Deckard , with Ana de Armas , Mackenzie Davis , Sylvia Hoeks , Lennie James , Carla Juri , Robin Wright , Dave Bautista and Jared Leto in supporting roles . The film is set to be released in the United States on October 6 , 2017 , in 2D , 3D and IMAX 3D . Warner Bros. . Pictures will distribute the film in the United States , while Columbia Pictures will handle international distribution . \nBlade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford , Rutger Hauer , Sean Young , and Edward James Olmos . The film , written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples , is a loose adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? by Philip K. Dick . The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in which genetically engineered replicants , which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans , are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation . The use of replicants on Earth is banned and they are exclusively utilized for dangerous or menial work on off-world colonies . Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and killed ( `` retired '' ) by special police operatives known as `` Blade Runners '' . The plot focuses on a group of recently escaped replicants led by Roy Batty ( Hauer ) , and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner , Rick Deckard ( Ford ) , who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down . During his investigations , Deckard begins a relationship with Rachael ( Young ) , an advanced replicant who causes him to question his and the replicants ' humanity .   Blade Runner initially polarized critics ; some were displeased with the pacing , while others enjoyed its thematic complexity . The year following its release , the film won the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation . Blade Runner underperformed in North American theaters , but has since become a cult film . Hailed for its production design , depicting a `` retrofitted '' future , it remains a leading example of the neo-noir genre . It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood and several later films were based on his work . Ridley Scott regards Blade Runner as `` probably '' his most complete and personal film . In 1993 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress , being deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' . Blade Runner is now regarded by many critics as one of the all-time best science fiction films .   Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives . A Director 's Cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to workprint screenings . This , in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental , made it one of the first films released on DVD , resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality . In 2007 , Warner Bros. released The Final Cut , a 25th anniversary digitally remastered version , which is the only one on which Scott had complete artistic freedom and was shown in selected theaters and subsequently released on DVD , HD DVD , and Blu-ray .

He is portrayed by Paul McGann .   The character was introduced in the 1996 TV film Doctor Who , a back-door pilot produced in an unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the series following its 1989 cancellation . While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance , his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent spin-off media , including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann . In 2013 , the actor reprised the role in the mini-episode `` The Night of the Doctor '' , which depicts the Eighth Doctor 's final adventure .   Within the series ' narrative , the Doctor is a centuries-old alien ( a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey ) who travels in time and space in his TARDIS , frequently with companions . When the Doctor is critically injured , he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it , a distinct new personality . McGann portrays the eighth such incarnation , a passionate , enthusiastic , and eccentric character . His only companion in the television film is Grace Holloway ( Daphne Ashbrook ) , a medical doctor whose surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration . In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas , novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions , including self-styled `` Edwardian Adventuress '' Charley , the alien Destrii and present-day humans Lucie and Sam .

Return a comma separated list of sentences.\n\nClaim: Touchscreens are used in game consoles.\n\nSource Text:\n\nA touchscreen is an input and output device normally layered on the top of an electronic visual display of an information processing system . A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or multi-touch gestures by touching the screen with a special stylus and/or one or more fingers . Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others may only work using a special stylus/pen . The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and to control how it is displayed ; for example , zooming to increase the text size .   The touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed , rather than using a mouse , touchpad , or any other such device ( other than a stylus , which is optional for most modern touchscreens ) .   Touchscreens are common in devices such as game consoles , personal computers , tablet computers , electronic voting machines , point of sale systems , and smartphones . They can also be attached to computers or , as terminals , to networks . They also play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) and some e-readers .   The popularity of smartphones , tablets , and many types of information appliances is driving the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics . Touchscreens are found in the medical field and in heavy industry , as well as for automated teller machines ( ATMs ) , and kiosks such as museum displays or room automation , where keyboard and mouse systems do not allow a suitably intuitive , rapid , or accurate interaction by the user with the display 's content .   Historically , the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based firmware have been made available by a wide array of after-market system integrators , and not by display , chip , or motherboard manufacturers . Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers worldwide have acknowledged the trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a highly desirable user interface component and have begun to integrate touchscreens into the fundamental design of their products .

Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services . Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message . It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal , i.e. , not directed to a particular individual .  Advertising is communicated through various mass media , including old media such as newspapers , magazines , Television , Radio , outdoor advertising or direct mail ; or new media such as search results , blogs , websites or text messages . The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or `` ad '' .   Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through `` branding , '' which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers . On the other hand , ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct response advertising . Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties , interest groups , religious organizations and governmental agencies . Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion , such as a public service announcement . Advertising may also be used to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful .   Modern advertising was created with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s , most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays , considered the founder of modern , `` Madison Avenue '' advertising .   In 2015 , the world spent an estimate of on advertising .

The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948 . The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products . Market town privileges were granted in 1441 , but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars . In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction .

It is a centre for research and education in the Nordic countries and home to Aarhus University , Scandinavia 's largest university , including Aarhus University Hospital and INCUBA Science Park . Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics , with 48,482 inhabitants aged under 18 , Aarhus is also the second fastest growing Danish city , with an average growth of 4,500 people per annum since 2008 .   Aarhus is notable for its musical history . In the 1950s many jazz clubs sprang up around the city , fuelled by the young population .

His father , Sir Keith Murdoch , had been a reporter , editor , and senior executive of the Herald and Weekly Times newspaper publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales . After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited . Murdoch thus had full control as Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation , now the world 's second-largest media conglomerate , and its successors , News Corp and 21st Century Fox , after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013 .   In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen ( and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship ) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens . Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International . On 1 July 2015 , Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox . Murdoch and his family own both 21st Century Fox and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust .   In July 2016 , after the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment , Murdoch was named the acting CEO of Fox News .

The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics , national policies and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War , and remains a part of popular culture to this day .

The Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver , British Columbia is named after him .   Growing up in Hull , a major seaport , Deighton and his brothers Tom and Richard learned to sail . Tom and Richard apprenticed on British ships , but Jack did not receive that opportunity . However , this meant he could switch to sailing on U.S. ships . When the California Gold Rush hit , ships were in demand to transport cargo and people from New York to San Francisco . In 1850 , this voyage around Cape Horn took 140 -- 160 days . Deighton signed up to work a new clipper Invincible that could sail 400 miles a day and made the trip in only 115 days . The next journey was to Hong Kong . Deighton was 21 years old and Third Officer . Next , Deighton visited family at home in England and then returned to the U.S. , never returning to England again .   Next , Deighton worked a gold claim in California , along with many others , until February 1858 when there was news of gold further north in a British territory known as New Caledonia . The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush had begun and Deighton sailed north along with thousands of others . The harsh winter took its toll on the prospectors but Deighton stayed for 5 years . He found no gold , though others did . New Caledonia was now the Colony of British Columbia . Traffic on the Fraser River was increasing as more miners arrived , but so far only American steamers were able to travel beyond Langley . Local boats were built to meet this need and Deighton piloted steamships and sternwheelers on the Fraser River for several years .   By 1864 , Deighton was forced to pursue other lines of work as he developed health problems ( swelling of the legs and feet ) .   Between 1862 and 1867 , he ran a bar called the Globe Saloon in New Westminster , British Columbia . It was quite prosperous due to the Cariboo Gold Rush . But in 1867 when Deighton went out of town to visit the hot mineral springs near Harrison Lake , he entrusted the bar to an old shipmate , an American . On July 4 the celebrations got out of hand and Deighton returned to find his business ruined .   In 1867 , Deighton opened a bar on the south side of Burrard Inlet at the behest of his old friend , Captain Edward Stamp , the owner of the Hastings Mill . He later named it the Globe Saloon in memory of his previous bar in New Westminster . He came to the area with little more than $ 6 to his name , a few simple pieces of furniture , his native wife ( whose name has been lost to the years ) , and a yellow dog . The bar was built by idle sawmill workers in exchange for all the whiskey they could drink in one sitting ( the nearest drinking hole was 25 miles away ) . His patrons were mainly sailors and workers from the nearby sawmill . When business dwindled there , Deighton tried to acquire 20 waterfront acres near Moody 's Mill and build a new saloon there . The local natives protested and the Governor agreed - Deighton went back to his previous bar , the Globe Saloon . This bar was demolished when the townsite of Granville was established . Deighton bought a nearby lot for $ 135 at the south-west corner of Carrall and Water Streets , where he built Deighton House .   Deighton 's native wife died . Before she died she arranged for Deighton to marry her 12-year-old niece Quahail-ya , also known as Madeline or Matrine . In 1871 she gave birth to Richard Mason Deighton . Jack 's brother Tom Deighton and his wife took over the business in 1873 and Jack returned to working the steamship that plied the Fraser River , this time as a Captain of the steamer Onward . However , after a family quarrel a few months later , Jack resumed management of the saloon and operated it until he became ill and died at the age of 44 on May 23 , 1875 . He is interred at the Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster , British Columbia . The location of the monument is ( WGS84 ) .   Deighton was known as Gassy Jack because of his talkative nature and his penchant for storytelling . The name stuck and the area around his bar is now known as Gastown .   He was succeeded by his son with Quahail-ya , Richard , who was derisively nicknamed the `` Earl of Granville '' . Richard died before Jack 's meager estate ( about $ 300 ) was probated . Quahail-ya returned to the North Shore and married `` Big William '' . She outlived him too , and died August 10 , 1948 , aged 90 .   The Deighton House was later burned in the Great Vancouver Fire of June 1886 .   In honour of Jack Deighton , the Gassy Jack statue stands in Maple Tree Square , in Gastown .

It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals ( prosigns ) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character ( letter or numeral ) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots ( one dash ) , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty .

Riddick , more commonly known as Riddick , is a fictional character and the antihero of four films in the Riddick series ( Pitch Black , The Chronicles of Riddick , the animated movie The Chronicles of Riddick : Dark Fury , and Riddick ) , as well as the two video games The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape from Butcher Bay and The Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena . Actor Vin Diesel has played the title role in all of the Riddick-based films and video games so far .   Within the canon of the series , Riddick is shown to be a highly skilled predator -- he is extremely mobile and stealthy - especially for someone of his size , has a vast knowledge of how to kill almost any humanoid in a variety of ways , is an extreme survivalist , and is notoriously hard to contain . He is also self-admittedly a dangerous convict and murderer -- yet despite this , he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions , usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature .   Riddick is a Furyan , a member of a warrior race obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate , and is one of the last of his kind . One of his most defining features are his eyes , a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species ( the Alpha-Furyans ) , although he implies in Pitch Black that they were `` shined '' by a back-alley surgical operation .

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .

Return a comma separated list of sentences.\n\nClaim: Matthias Corvinus had one of the largest collections of books in Europe during the Enlightenment.\n\nSource Text:\nMatthias Corvinus , also called Matthias I ( Hunyadi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s , Matija Korvin , Matia Corvin , Matej Korv\u00edn , Maty\u00e1\u0161 Korv\u00edn 23 February 1443 -- 6 April 1490 ) , was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1458 to 1490 . After conducting several military campaigns , he was elected King of Bohemia in 1469 and adopted the title Duke of Austria in 1487 . He was the son of John Hunyadi , Regent of Hungary , who died in 1456 . In 1457 , Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother , Ladislaus Hunyadi , on the orders of King Ladislaus V of Hungary . Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed , causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary . After the King died unexpectedly , Matthias 's uncle Michael Szil\u00e1gyi persuaded the Estates to unanimously proclaim Matthias king on 24 January 1458 . He began his rule under his uncle 's guardianship , but he took effective control of government within two weeks .   As king , Matthias waged wars against the Czech mercenaries who dominated Upper Hungary ( today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary ) and against Frederick III , Holy Roman Emperor , who claimed Hungary for himself . In this period , the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia , terminating the zone of buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary . Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463 , acknowledging the Emperor 's right to style himself King of Hungary . The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464 . In this year , Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia . He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy .   Matthias introduced new taxes and regularly collected extraordinary taxes . These measures caused a rebellion in Transylvania in 1467 , but he subdued the rebels . The next year , Matthias declared war on George of Pod\u011bbrady , the Hussite King of Bohemia , and conquered Moravia , Silesia , and Lausitz , but he could not occupy Bohemia proper . The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469 , but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of George of Pod\u011bbrady in 1471 . Instead , they elected Vladislaus Jagiellon , the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland . A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus 's younger brother Casimir , but Matthias overcame their rebellion . Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at Breslau in Silesia ( now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland ) in late 1474 , Matthias turned against the Ottomans , who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary . He sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great , Prince of Moldavia , enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s . In 1476 , Matthias besieged and seized \u0160abac , an important Ottoman border fort . He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478 , confirming the division of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown between them . Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied Lower Austria between 1482 and 1487 .   Matthias established a professional army ( the Black Army of Hungary ) , reformed the administration of justice , reduced the power of the barons , and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses . Matthias patronized art and science ; his royal library , the Bibliotheca Corviniana , was one of the largest collections of books in Europe . With his patronage , Hungary became the first country to embrace the Renaissance from Italy . As Matthias the Just , the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise , he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales . \nBibliotheca Corviniana was one of the most renowned libraries of the Renaissance world , established by Matthias Corvinus , King of Hungary between 1458 and 1490 . It was destroyed after the Hungarian defeat by the Ottomans in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 .

After spending long periods of time touring the US , Albarn 's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s . The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish ( 1993 ) , Parklife ( 1994 ) and The Great Escape ( 1995 ) . All three albums received critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK , aided by a Britpop rivalry with Oasis .

The half-hour-long show premiered on July 21 , 1996 , and was first hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 17 , 1998 . Jon Stewart then took over as the host from January 11 , 1999 until August 6 , 2015 , making the show more strongly focused on politics and the national media , in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn 's tenure . Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah , whose tenure premiered on September 28 , 2015 . Under different hosts , the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015 , and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah since 2015 .

Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests , some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments . Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment . Stewart 's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire '' picked up this debate , where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network .

( from Latin iuvent\u016bs , `` youth '' ; [ ju\u02c8v\u025bntus ] ) , colloquially known as Juve ( [ \u02c8ju\u02d0ve ] ) , is a professional Italian association football club based in Turin , Piedmont , founded in 1897 by a group of young Torinese students , among them was their first president Eugenio Canfari and his brother Enrico , author of the company 's historical memory . The club is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section ( 1893 ) , has traditionally worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played its home matches in several grounds , being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Juventus is also the most successful club in Italian football , the one that has the most sporting tradition in the country and one of the most awarded globally having won overall sixty-three official titles on the national and international stage , more than any other club in Italy : a record thirty-three official league titles , a record twelve Coppa Italia titles , a record seven Supercoppa Italiana titles and , with eleven titles in confederation and inter-confederation competitions ( two Intercontinental Cups , two European Champion Clubs ' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup ) it ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won .   Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus initially as a athletics club , it has spent uninterruptedly in the top flight league system ( reformulated as Serie A since 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006 -- 07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family since 1923 to 1943 and since 1947 until the date . The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the ( now-defunct ) Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup ( the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament ) . With its successive triumphs in the Super Cup in 1984 and in the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the club become also the first in the world -- and remains the only one at present -- to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies , an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999 . In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters groups -- often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin -- , it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and abroad , mainly in countries with a significant presence of Italian immigrants , making Juventus a symbol of campanilismo ( `` Anti-parochialism '' ) and italianit\u00e0 ( `` Italianness '' ) along with the club 's tradition of success , some of which have had a significant impact in Italian society , especially in the 1930s and the first post-war decade , as well as the ideological politics and socio-economic origin of the club 's sympathisers and the club 's contribution to the national team -- the most for an Italian club -- , uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football , having performed a decisive role in the Azzurri 's World Cup triumphs of 1934 , 1982 and 2006 .

Hourglass was an introspective album that earned Taylor his best critical reviews in almost twenty years . The album 's lyrics focused largely on Taylor 's troubled past and family . `` Jump Up Behind Me '' paid tribute to his father 's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days , and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill . `` Enough to Be On Your Way '' was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade . The themes were also inspired by Taylor 's divorce from actress Kathryn Walker , which took place in 1996 . Rolling Stone found that `` one of the themes of this record is disbelief '' , while Taylor told the magazine that it was `` spirituals for agnostics . '' Critics embraced the dark themes on the album , and Hourglass was a huge commercial success , reaching # 9 on the Billboard 200 ( Taylor 's first Top 10 album in sixteen years ) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on `` Little More Time With You '' .

It is about creating something new by thinking across boundaries . It is related to an interdiscipline or an interdisciplinary field , which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought , as new needs and professions emerge .   The term interdisciplinary is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study . Interdisciplinarity involves researchers , students , and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought , professions , or technologies -- along with their specific perspectives -- in the pursuit of a common task . The epidemiology of AIDS or global warming requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems . Interdisciplinary may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions , for example , women 's studies or ethnic area studies . Interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields .   The adjective interdisciplinary is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand , including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines . For example , the subject of land use may appear differently when examined by different disciplines , for instance , biology , chemistry , economics , geography , and politics . \nSpeech recognition ( SR ) is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers . It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems . These speech industry players include Google , Microsoft , IBM , Baidu , Apple , Amazon , Nuance , SoundHound , IflyTek , CDAC many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning .

It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was # 45.5 billion ( # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .

The series , created by Robert and Michelle King , stars Julianna Margulies , Josh Charles , Christine Baranski , Matt Czuchry , Archie Panjabi , and Alan Cumming , and features Chris Noth in a recurring role . The executive producers are Ridley Scott , Charles McDougall , and David W. Zucker . The Good Wife is a heavily serialized show featuring several story arcs that carry over several episodes , as well as stand-alone procedural storylines that are concluded by the end of each episode . The serial plots have been especially showcased in its highly praised fifth season . This is a rarity among The Good Wifes broadcaster CBS , as most of its shows are procedural .   The Good Wife won numerous prestigious awards , including five Emmys and the 2014 Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama . The performances of the show 's cast have been particularly recognized , with Julianna Margulies 's role as Alicia Florrick receiving significant praise . The show has especially received wide acclaim for its insight on social media and the internet in society , politics and law . With the current climate of how television shows are written and produced , The Good Wife is considered by several critics to be network television 's last great drama producing a full 22 episode season while other and future acclaimed shows are in favor of shorter 6 -- 12 episode seasons .

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica , although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty .   The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .   Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing . The regime , headed by Augusto Pinochet , ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010 .   Chile is today one of South America 's most stable and prosperous nations . It leads Latin American nations in rankings of human development , competitiveness , income per capita , globalization , state of peace , economic freedom , and low perception of corruption . It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state , and democratic development . Chile is a founding member of the United Nations , the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) .

He is also a guitarist and vocalist for the punk rock band Pinhead Gunpowder and provides lead vocals for Green Day 's side projects Foxboro Hot Tubs and The Network .   Raised in Rodeo , California , Armstrong developed an interest in music at a young age , and recorded his first song at the age of five . He met Mike Dirnt while attending elementary school , and the two instantly bonded over their mutual interest in music , forming the band Sweet Children when the two were 15 years old . The band changed its name to Green Day , and would later achieve massive commercial success . Armstrong has also pursued musical projects outside of Green Day 's work , including numerous collaborations with other musicians .   In 1997 , to coincide with the release of Nimrod , Armstrong founded Adeline Records in Oakland to help support other bands releasing music and signed bands such as The Frustrators , AFI and Dillinger Four .

With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal ( with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God ) and nu metal ( with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park ) , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

Return a comma separated list of sentences.\n\nClaim: Animals are part of the History of Earth.\n\nSource Text:\n\nThe history of Earth concerns the development of the planet Earth from its formation to the present day . Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of the Earth 's past . The age of Earth is approximately one-third of the age of the universe . An immense amount of geological change has occurred in that timespan , accompanied by the emergence of life and its subsequent evolution .   Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula . Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean ; but the atmosphere contained almost no oxygen and so would have been toxic to most modern life including humans . Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism . A giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia while Earth was in its earliest stage , also known as Early Earth , is thought to have been responsible for forming the Moon . Over time , the Earth cooled , causing the formation of a solid crust , and allowing liquid water to exist on the surface .   The geological time scale ( GTS ) clock ( see graphic ) depicts the larger spans of time from the beginning of the Earth as well as a chronology of some definitive events of Earth history . The Hadean Eon represents time before the reliable ( fossil ) record of life beginning on Earth ; it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 billion years ago as defined by international convention . The Archean and Proterozoic eons follow ; they produced the abiogenesis of life on Earth and then the evolution of early life . The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic , which is represented by its three component eras : the Palaeozoic ; the Mesozoic , which spanned the rise , reign , and climactic extinction of the huge dinosaurs ; and the Cenozoic , which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on Earth .   Hominins , the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade , rose sometime during the latter part of the Miocene epoch ; the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 mya . The succeeding Quaternary period is the time of recognizable humans , i.e. , the genus Homo , but that period 's two million-year-plus term of the recent times is too small to be visible at the scale of the GTS graphic . ( Notes re the graphic : Ga means `` billion years '' ; Ma , `` million years '' . )   The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland as well as `` remains of biotic life '' found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , `` If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . ''   Living forms derived from photosynthesis appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today ; and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described .   Geological change has been a constant of Earth 's crust since the time of its formation , and biological change since the first appearance of life . Species continue to evolve , taking on new forms , splitting into daughter species or going extinct in the process of adapting or dying in response to ever-changing physical environments . The process of plate tectonics continues to play a dominant role in the shaping of Earth 's oceans and continents and the living species they harbor . Changes in the biosphere -- now dominated by human activity -- continue , in turn , to produce significant effects on the atmosphere and other systems of the Earth 's surface , such as the integrity of the ozone layer , the proliferation of greenhouse gases , the conditions of productive soils and clean air and water , and others . \nMulticellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell , in contrast to unicellular organisms .   All species of animals , land plants and most fungi are multicellular , as are many algae , whereas a few organisms are partially uni - and partially multicellular , like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus Dictyostelium .   Multicellular organisms arise in various different ways , for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells . Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony . However , it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms , because the two concepts are not distinct ; colonial protists have been dubbed `` pluricellular '' rather than `` multicellular '' . \nLife is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes , such as signaling and self-sustaining processes , from those that do not , either because such functions have ceased , or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate . Various forms of life exist , such as plants , animals , fungi , protists , archaea , and bacteria . The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses , viroids , or potential artificial life as `` living '' . Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life , although many other sciences are involved .   The definition of life is controversial . The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis , are composed of cells , undergo metabolism , can grow , adapt to their environment , respond to stimuli , and reproduce . However , many other biological definitions have been proposed , and there are some borderline cases of life , such as viruses . Throughout history , there have been many attempts to define what is meant by `` life '' and many theories on the properties and emergence of living things , such as materialism , the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it ; hylomorphism , the belief that all things are a combination of matter and form , and the form of a living thing is its soul ; spontaneous generation , the belief that life repeatedly emerges from non-life ; and vitalism , a now largely discredited hypothesis that living organisms possess a `` life force '' or `` vital spark '' . Modern definitions are more complex , with input from a diversity of scientific disciplines . Biophysicists have proposed many definitions based on chemical systems ; there are also some living systems theories , such as the Gaia hypothesis , the idea that the Earth itself is alive . Another theory is that life is the property of ecological systems , and yet another is elaborated in complex systems biology , a branch or subfield of mathematical biology . Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter , such as simple organic compounds . Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions .   Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago , soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago , and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago . Earth 's current life may have descended from an RNA world , although RNA-based life may not have been the first . The mechanism by which life began on Earth is unknown , though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the Miller -- Urey experiment . The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes believed to be present in the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) of all living organisms .   Since its primordial beginnings , life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale . To survive in most ecosystems , life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions . Some microorganisms , called extremophiles , thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth . Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms . Later , Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species . Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered , such as cells and microorganisms , forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms . Cells are sometimes considered the smallest units and `` building blocks '' of life . There are two kinds of cells , prokaryotic and eukaryotic , both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . Cells reproduce through a process of cell division , in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells .   Though currently only known on Earth , life need not be restricted to it , and many scientists believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life . Artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life , which is often used to examine systems related to natural life . Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism , and as such , is the end of its life . Extinction is the process by which an entire group or taxon , normally a species , dies out . Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms . \nThe Miocene ( [ pron\u02c8ma\u026a\u0259\u02ccsi\u02d0n ] ) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about ( Ma ) . The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell . Its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , `` less '' ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , `` new '' ) and means `` less recent '' because it has 18 % fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch .   The earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , with the climate slowly cooling towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch .   The apes arose and diversified during the Miocene , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the Miocene seas , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems .  The plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern .

He is currently the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock band Angels & Airwaves and was the guitarist , co-lead vocalist and co-founder of the American rock band Blink-182 from 1992 to 2015 . DeLonge grew up in the suburbs of Poway , California , where he embraced skateboarding at an early age . DeLonge received his first guitar shortly thereafter and began writing original punk rock songs . He formed Blink-182 with bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor during his high school years . The band created a following in the mid-1990s through independent releases and relentless touring , particularly in their home country and in Australia . They signed to MCA Records in 1996 and their second album , Dude Ranch ( 1997 ) , featured the hit single `` Dammit '' .   The group encountered bigger success with Enema of the State ( 1999 ) , which featured three hit singles and went quadruple-platinum in the US , eventually selling upwards of 15 million copies worldwide . Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001 's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket . DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer , which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002 , but dissolved the following year . Blink 's eponymous fifth studio album ( 2003 ) reflected a change in tone within the group , which broke up in 2005 following internal tension , spearheaded by DeLonge .   In the aftermath of Blink-182 's breakup , he formed Angels & Airwaves , which has since released five studio albums and has evolved into an `` art project '' , encompassing various forms of media . DeLonge reunited with Blink-182 in 2009 , releasing new music and touring frequently , before parting ways with the band again in 2015 . In addition to his musical career , DeLonge also manages business ventures that he founded : Macbeth Footwear , and technology and design firm Modlife . He helped score and produce the 2011 science fiction film Love , and has multiple film projects in development . He has also expanded into writing , releasing a children 's book , The Lonely Astronaut on Christmas Eve , in 2013 .

Gaga began planning the project in 2011 , shortly after the launch of her second studio album , Born This Way . Work continued until 2013 while Gaga was traveling for her Born This Way Ball concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring .   Gaga described Artpop as `` a celebration and a poetic musical journey '' and an exploration of the `` reverse Warholian '' phenomenon in pop culture . It displays an intentional `` lack of maturity and responsibility '' by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way . Gaga collaborated with longtime partners Paul `` DJ White Shadow '' Blair and RedOne and new partners Zedd and Madeon . The lyrical themes revolve around her personal views of fame , love , sex , feminism , self-empowerment , overcoming addiction , and reactions to media scrutiny ; references include Greek and Roman mythology , and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra . Artpop also features guest vocals from T.I. , Too Short , Twista , and R. Kelly .   The release of Artpop was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed an `` ArtRave '' . The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics , but was commercially successful , debuting at number one on the United States Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 258,000 copies , becoming Gaga 's second consecutive number-one record in the United States and selling 757,000 copies . It also topped national record charts in five additional countries , and charted within the top ten in over twenty . Artpop was the ninth best seller album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide . It was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications .   `` Applause '' was released as the lead single from Artpop on August 12 , 2013 , and was a critical and commercial success , charting within the top ten of more than twenty countries worldwide , peaking at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 . The second single `` Do What U Want '' was released on October 21 , and peaked at number 13 in the United States . It was followed by promotional singles `` Venus '' and `` Dope '' shortly before the album 's release . `` G.U.Y. '' was the third and last single released from the album .

Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings , usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece , and emphasizing the drum and bass parts ( this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a riddim ) . Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo , reverb , panoramic delay , and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works . It was an early form of popular electronic music .   Dub was pioneered by Osbourne `` King Tubby '' Ruddock , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry , Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s . Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub , and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre . Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy . These producers , especially Ruddock and Perry , looked upon the mixing console as an instrument , manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different .  Dub has influenced many genres of music , including rock ( most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk ) , pop , hip hop , disco , and later house , techno , ambient , electronic dance music , and trip hop . Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass Traditional dub has survived , and some of the originators , such as Lee `` Scratch '' Perry and Mad Professor , continue to produce new material .

At the time , U.S. senators were elected by state legislatures ; thus Lincoln and Douglas were trying for their respective parties to win control of the Illinois legislature . The debates previewed the issues that Lincoln would face in the aftermath of his victory in the 1860 presidential election . Although Illinois was a free state , the main issue discussed in all seven debates was slavery in the United States .   In agreeing to the official debates , Lincoln and Douglas decided to hold one debate in each of the nine congressional districts in Illinois . Because both had already spoken in two -- Springfield and Chicago -- within a day of each other , they decided that their `` joint appearances '' would be held only in the remaining seven districts .   The debates were held in seven towns in the state of Illinois :  Ottawa on August 21  Freeport on August 27  Jonesboro on September 15  Charleston on September 18  Galesburg on October 7  Quincy on October 13  Alton on October 15   The debates in Freeport , Quincy and Alton drew especially large numbers of people from neighboring states , as the issue of slavery was of monumental importance to citizens across the nation . Newspaper coverage of the debates was intense . Major papers from Chicago sent stenographers to create complete texts of each debate , which newspapers across the United States reprinted in full , with some partisan edits . Newspapers that supported Douglas edited his speeches to remove any errors made by the stenographers and to correct grammatical errors , while they left Lincoln 's speeches in the rough form in which they had been transcribed . In the same way , pro-Lincoln papers edited Lincoln 's speeches , but left the Douglas texts as reported .   After losing the election for Senator in Illinois , Lincoln edited the texts of all the debates and had them published in a book . The widespread coverage of the original debates and the subsequent popularity of the book led eventually to Lincoln 's nomination for President of the United States by the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago .   The format for each debate was : one candidate spoke for 60 minutes , then the other candidate spoke for 90 minutes , and then the first candidate was allowed a 30-minute `` rejoinder . '' The candidates alternated speaking first . As the incumbent , Douglas spoke first in four of the debates . \nQuincy ( [ \u02c8kw\u026ansi ] ) , known as Illinois 's `` Gem City , '' is a city on the Mississippi River and the county seat of Adams County , Illinois , United States . The 2010 census counted a population of 40,633 in the city itself , up from 40,366 in 2000 . As of July 1 , 2015 , the Quincy Micro Area had an estimated population of 77,220 .   During the 19th Century , Quincy was a thriving transportation center as riverboats and rail service linked the city to many destinations west and along the river . It was once Illinois ' second-largest city , surpassing Peoria in 1870 .

In 2015 , around 975,260 people lived within the city 's administrative limits . The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320 . Naples is the 9th-most populous urban area in the European Union with a population of between 3 million and 3.7 million . About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area , one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea .   Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world . Bronze Age Greek settlements were established in the Naples area in the second millennium BC . A larger colony -- initially known as Parthenope , \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7 -- developed on the Island of Megaride around the ninth century BC , at the end of the Greek Dark Ages . The city was refounded as Ne\u00e1polis in the sixth century BC and became a lynchpin of Magna Graecia , playing a key role in the merging of Greek culture into Roman society and eventually becoming a cultural centre of the Roman Republic . Naples remained influential after the fall of the Western Roman Empire , serving as the capital city of the Kingdom of Naples between 1282 and 1816 . Thereafter , in union with Sicily , it became the capital of the Two Sicilies until the unification of Italy in 1861 .   Naples was the most-bombed Italian city during World War II . Much of the city 's 20th-century periphery was constructed under Benito Mussolini 's fascist government , and during reconstruction efforts after World War II . In recent decades , Naples has constructed a large business district , the Centro Direzionale , and has developed an advanced transport infrastructure , including an Alta Velocit\u00e0 high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno , and an expanded subway network , which is planned to eventually cover half of the region . The city has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades , and unemployment levels in the city and surrounding Campania have decreased since 1999 .

The city also hosts NATO 's Allied Joint Force Command Naples , the SRM Institution for Economic Research and the OPE Company and Study Centre . Naples was a full member of the Eurocities network of European cities . The city was selected to become the headquarters of the European institution ACP/UE and was named a City of Literature by UNESCO 's Creative Cities Network . The Villa Rosebery , one of the three official residences of the President of Italy , is located in the city 's Posillipo district .   Naples ' historic city centre is the largest in Europe , covering 1700 ha and enclosing 27 centuries of history , and is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . Naples has long been a major cultural centre with a global sphere of influence , particularly during the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras . In the immediate vicinity of Naples are numerous culturally and historically significant sites , including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Culinarily , Naples is synonymous with pizza , which originated in the city . Neapolitan music has furthermore been highly influential , credited with the invention of the romantic guitar and the mandolin , as well as notable contributions to opera and folk standards . Popular characters and historical figures who have come to symbolise the city include Januarius , the patron saint of Naples , the comic figure Pulcinella , and the Sirens from the Greek epic poem the Odyssey .
