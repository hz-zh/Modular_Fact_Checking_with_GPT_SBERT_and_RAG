These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland -LRB- 1889 -- 1936 -RRB- in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government -LRB- 2004 -- 2012 -RRB- and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 .

Manson 's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August of 1969 .

Manson was originally sentenced to death ; however , his death sentence was converted to life with the possibility of parole when in 1972 , the death penalty in California was ruled unconstitutional . California did not have the life-without-parole sentence at the time . Manson also received first-degree murder convictions for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald `` Shorty '' Shea . He is currently serving a life sentence at California State Prison , Corcoran , in Corcoran , California .   Manson believed in what he called `` Helter Skelter '' , a term he took from the Beatles ' song of the same name . Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war , which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles ' song . He believed the murders would help precipitate that war . From the beginning of his notoriety , a pop culture arose around him in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity , violence and the macabre .   At the time the Family began to form , Manson was an unemployed former convict , who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses . Before the murders , he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry , chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson , drummer and founding member of the Beach Boys . After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted , recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially .

His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven -LRB- c. 347 BC -RRB- . His writings cover many subjects -- including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy . Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC .   Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies . He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books . The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism , but , following Plato 's death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism . He believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception . Aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .   Aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl -LRB- reproductive -RRB- arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century . His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .   In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church . Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' -LRB- -LSB- -RRB- .   His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today . Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .

Discovered by actress Norma Shearer , Leigh made her acting debut on radio in 1946 and secured a contract with MGM the following year . Early in her career , she appeared in popular films spanning a wide variety of genres , including Act of Violence -LRB- 1948 -RRB- , Little Women -LRB- 1949 -RRB- , Angels in the Outfield -LRB- 1951 -RRB- , Scaramouche -LRB- 1952 -RRB- , The Naked Spur -LRB- 1953 -RRB- and Living It Up -LRB- 1954 -RRB- .

The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England -LRB- the largest of the three realms -RRB- from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie -LRB- 1597 -RRB- , The True Law of Free Monarchies -LRB- 1598 -RRB- , and Basilikon Doron -LRB- 1599 -RRB- . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch .

Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis -LRB- of which he had been one of the architects -RRB- , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa .

In 2005 , Packouz -LRB- 23 years old at the time -RRB- joined Efraim Diveroli -LRB- 19 years old at the time -RRB- in Diveroli 's arms company AEY Inc. . By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million . In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions . The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition . Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller . Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .

The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC .   After the demise of the Second Triumvirate , Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies . In reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator . By law , Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate , including supreme military command , and those of tribune and censor . It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule . He rejected monarchical titles , and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis -LRB- `` First Citizen of the State '' -RRB- . The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate , the first phase of the Roman Empire .   The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana -LRB- The Roman Peace -RRB- . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the `` Year of the Four Emperors '' over the imperial succession . Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire , annexing Egypt , Dalmatia , Pannonia , Noricum , and Raetia ; expanding possessions in Africa ; expanding into Germania ; and completing the conquest of Hispania .   Beyond the frontiers , he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy . He reformed the Roman system of taxation , developed networks of roads with an official courier system , established a standing army , established the Praetorian Guard , created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome , and rebuilt much of the city during his reign .   Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75 . He probably died from natural causes , although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him . He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son -LRB- also stepson and former son-in-law -RRB- Tiberius .

He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons . After winning championships in high school and college , Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers . He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season , and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s . Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV , but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game , winning the All-Star MVP Award . After protests from his fellow players , he retired again for four years , but returned in 1996 , at age 36 , to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time .   Johnson 's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards , nine NBA Finals appearances , twelve All-Star games , and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations . He led the league in regular-season assists four times , and is the NBA 's all-time leader in average assists per game , at 11.2 .

With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal -LRB- with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God -RRB- and nu metal -LRB- with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park -RRB- , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

The club is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section -LRB- 1893 -RRB- , has traditionally worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played its home matches in several grounds , being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Juventus is also the most successful club in Italian football , the one that has the most sporting tradition in the country and one of the most awarded globally having won overall sixty-three official titles on the national and international stage , more than any other club in Italy : a record thirty-three official league titles , a record twelve Coppa Italia titles , a record seven Supercoppa Italiana titles and , with eleven titles in confederation and inter-confederation competitions -LRB- two Intercontinental Cups , two European Champion Clubs ' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup -RRB- it ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won .

The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the -LRB- now-defunct -RRB- Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup -LRB- the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament -RRB- .

In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide .

It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon -LRB- Yr Wyddfa -RRB- , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff -LRB- the capital -RRB- , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added -LRB- GVA -RRB- was # 45.5 billion -LRB- # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain -RRB- .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .

Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year , much in the same vein that its rival , the World Wrestling Entertainment , regards WrestleMania . As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .   From 1983 to 1987 , Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions -LRB- JCP -RRB- , the dominant promotion of the NWA , and aired on Thanksgiving Day . In 1987 , the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own , Survivor Series , on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event . In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum .

The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915 , the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up , arrested , and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara , the majority of whom were eventually murdered .  The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly , and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide , and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide .   Raphael Lemkin was explicitly moved by the Armenian annihilation , to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943 . The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides , because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out in order to eliminate the Armenians , and it is the second most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust .   Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , denies the word genocide as an accurate term for the mass killings of Armenians that began under Ottoman rule in 1915 . It has in recent years been faced with repeated calls to recognize them as genocide . To date , 29 countries and 46 US states have officially recognized the mass killings as genocide , as have most genocide scholars and historians .

Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union , achieving statehood on February 14 , 1912 .

Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation \u2212 where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases -LRB- CVD -RRB- are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment .

The phenomenon revealed differences in human colour perception which have been the subject of ongoing scientific investigation in neuroscience and vision science , with a number of papers published in peer-reviewed science journals .   The photo originated from a washed-out colour photograph of a dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr , and a dispute over whether the dress pictured was blue and black , or white and gold . In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone , more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress , using hashtags such as #thedress , #whiteandgold and #blackandblue . Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be black and blue , the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms , with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour . At the same time , members of the scientific community began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision .   The dress itself , which was identified as a product of the retailer Roman Originals , experienced a major surge in sales as a result of the incident . The retailer also produced a one-off version of the dress actually coloured in white and gold as a charity campaign .

The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , there are also cortical areas associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , a motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with a particular side of the brain , such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts known as commisures , the largest being the corpus callosum .   The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts known as peduncles . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system of the brain , which consists of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .   The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets . These connections form various neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry of the brain is driven by the process of neurotransmission .   The brain is protected by the skull , suspended in cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood -- brain barrier . However , the brain is still susceptible to damage , disease , and infection . Damage can be caused by trauma , or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke . The brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , forms of dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , and multiple sclerosis . A number of psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia and clinical depression , are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions , although the nature of these is not well understood . The brain can also be the site of tumours , both benign and malignant . Malignant tumours mostly originate from sites outside the brain .   The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy , while the study of its function is neuroscience . A number of different techniques are used to study the brain . Brain specimens from other animals , which may be examined microscopically , have been a traditional source of much information . Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography -LRB- EEG -RRB- recordings are important techniques in studying the brain . Examining the medical history of people with brain injury has also provided great insight into the function of each part of the brain .

Dalai Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school , the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism which is nominally headed by the Ganden Tripas . From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to 1959 , the central government of Tibet , the Ganden Phodrang , invested the position of Dalai Lama with temporal duties .   The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser village , Amdo , Tibet -LRB- was administratively in Qinghai province , Republic of China -RRB- , and was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama at a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939 . His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 , and he eventually assumed full temporal -LRB- political -RRB- duties on 17 November 1950 , at the age of 15 , after the People 's Republic of China 's invasion of Tibet . The Gelug school 's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the Tibet Autonomous Region just as the nascent PRC wished to assert central control over it .   During the 1959 Tibetan uprising , the Dalai Lama fled to India , where he currently lives as a refugee . The 14th Dalai Lama received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 . He has traveled the world and has spoken about the welfare of Tibetans , environment , economics , women 's rights , non-violence , interfaith dialogue , physics , astronomy , Buddhism and science , cognitive neuroscience , reproductive health , and sexuality , along with various Mahayana and Vajrayana topics .

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper .

Directed by Spike Lee , the film stars Derek Luke , Michael Ealy , Laz Alonso , Omar Benson Miller , Pierfrancesco Favino and Valentina Cervi . Set primarily in Italy during German-occupied Europe in World War II , the film tells the story of four Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division who seek refuge in a small Tuscan village , where they form a bond with the residents . The story is presented as a flashback , as one survivor reflects upon his experiences in a frame story set in 1980s New York . Several real-life events that occurred during the war , such as the Sant ` Anna di Stazzema massacre , are re-enacted , placing Miracle at St. Anna within the genre of historical fiction .   Lee first learned of the novel in 2004 and approached McBride with the idea of a film adaptation . In Europe , the film 's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini , who helped finance the $ 45 million production . A majority of the film was shot in Italy , on several locations affected by World War II . Other filming locations included New York , Louisiana and The Bahamas . Frequent Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard composed the score , and the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic .   Miracle at St. Anna premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival before it was released on September 26 , 2008 . It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies . During its theatrical run , Miracle at St. Anna was a box office disappointment , grossing only $ 9.3 million worldwide .

It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals -LRB- prosigns -RRB- as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character -LRB- letter or numeral -RRB- or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots -LRB- one dash -RRB- , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty .

She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to -LSB- her -RSB- life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .   In addition to her vampire novels , Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints -LRB- adapted for television in 2001 -RRB- and Servant of the Bones , which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries . Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers . Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure , including Exit to Eden , which was later adapted into a 1994 film .

Return a comma separated list of sentences.\n\nClaim: Speech recognition incorporates knowledge and research into multiple fields.\n\nSource Text: Linguistics is the scientific study of language , and involves an analysis of language form , language meaning , and language in context . The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE Indian grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini , who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his .   Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between sound and meaning . Phonetics is the study of speech and non-speech sounds , and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties . The study of language meaning , on the other hand , deals with how languages encode relations between entities , properties , and other aspects of the world to convey , process , and assign meaning , as well as manage and resolve ambiguity . While the study of semantics typically concerns itself with truth conditions , pragmatics deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning .   Grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language . These rules apply to sound as well as meaning , and include componential sub-sets of rules , such as those pertaining to phonology -LRB- the organisation of phonetic sound systems -RRB- , morphology -LRB- the formation and composition of words -RRB- , and syntax -LRB- the formation and composition of phrases and sentences -RRB- . Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within Noam Chomsky 's ideological school of generative linguistics .   In the early 20th century , Ferdinand de Saussure distinguished between the notions of langue and parole in his formulation of structural linguistics . According to him , parole is the specific utterance of speech , whereas langue refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language . This distinction resembles the one made by Noam Chomsky between competence and performance in his theory of transformative or generative grammar . According to Chomsky , competence is an individual 's innate capacity and potential for language -LRB- like in Saussure 's langue -RRB- , while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals , groups , and communities -LRB- i.e. , parole , in Saussurean terms -RRB- .   The study of parole -LRB- which manifests through cultural discourses and dialects -RRB- is the domain of sociolinguistics , the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain speech community -LRB- governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws -RRB- . Discourse analysis further examines the structure of texts and conversations emerging out of a speech community 's usage of language . This is done through the collection of linguistic data , or through the formal discipline of corpus linguistics , which takes naturally occurring texts and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora -LRB- or corpus data -RRB- .   Stylistics also involves the study of written , signed , or spoken discourse through varying speech communities , genres , and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media . In the 1960s , Jacques Derrida , for instance , further distinguished between speech and writing , by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself . Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts -LRB- as signs and symbols -RRB- in language . The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics , which explores the representation and function of language in the mind ; neurolinguistics , which studies language processing in the brain ; biolinguistics , which studies the biology and evolution of language ; and language acquisition , which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages .   Linguistics also deals with the social , cultural , historical and political factors that influence language , through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined . Research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focus on how languages change and grow , particularly over an extended period of time .   Language documentation combines anthropological inquiry -LRB- into the history and culture of language -RRB- with linguistic inquiry , in order to describe languages and their grammars . Lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary . Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary . Computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective . Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation , as well as in language education -- the teaching of a second or foreign language . Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research .   Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of semiotics -LRB- the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols -RRB- , literary criticism -LRB- the historical and ideological analysis of literature , cinema , art , or published material -RRB- , translation -LRB- the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another -RRB- , and speech-language pathology -LRB- a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the cognitive level -RRB- .

In 2003 , James Wan and Leigh Whannell created a short film to help pitch as a potential feature film . This was successfully done in 2004 with the release of the first installment at the Sundance Film Festival . It was released theatrically that October . The sequels were directed by Darren Lynn Bousman , David Hackl , and Kevin Greutert , and were written by Wan , Whannell , Bousman , Patrick Melton , and Marcus Dunstan , and were released subsequently every October , on the Friday before Halloween , between 2004 and 2010 . Both of the creators remained with the franchise as executive producers . On July 22 , 2010 , producer Mark Burg confirmed that the seventh film , Saw 3D , is the final installment of the series . Series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell are still open to continuing the series , however , if they can do something `` different '' with the material . The films collectively grossed over $ 873 million at the box office worldwide . Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise in 2012 with a reboot . However , in November 2013 , it was reported that they were in active development of a sequel .   The franchise revolves around John Kramer , also called the `` Jigsaw Killer '' or simply `` Jigsaw '' . He was introduced briefly in Saw and developed in more detail in Saw II . Rather than killing his victims outright , Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls `` tests '' or `` games '' to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture . Despite the fact that John was murdered in Saw III , the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via flashbacks .   The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics , but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest grossing horror film franchies of all time . While the films are often compared to the American horror film Hostel -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and classified as torture porn by critics , the creators of Saw disagree with the term `` torture porn '' . Writer Luke Y. Thompson of OC Weekly argued that , unlike Hostel , the Saw films actually have less torture than most in the sense of sadism or masochism , as Jigsaw believes that those who survive his methods will be stronger people for it . He called him a kind of a '' -LRB- deranged -RRB- philanthropist '' . "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The films collectively grossed over $ 873 million at the box office worldwide ."}]}

Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of the Earth 's past . The age of Earth is approximately one-third of the age of the universe . An immense amount of geological change has occurred in that timespan , accompanied by the emergence of life and its subsequent evolution .   Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula . Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean ; but the atmosphere contained almost no oxygen and so would have been toxic to most modern life including humans . Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism . A giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia while Earth was in its earliest stage , also known as Early Earth , is thought to have been responsible for forming the Moon . Over time , the Earth cooled , causing the formation of a solid crust , and allowing liquid water to exist on the surface .   The geological time scale -LRB- GTS -RRB- clock -LRB- see graphic -RRB- depicts the larger spans of time from the beginning of the Earth as well as a chronology of some definitive events of Earth history . The Hadean Eon represents time before the reliable -LRB- fossil -RRB- record of life beginning on Earth ; it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 billion years ago as defined by international convention . The Archean and Proterozoic eons follow ; they produced the abiogenesis of life on Earth and then the evolution of early life . The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic , which is represented by its three component eras : the Palaeozoic ; the Mesozoic , which spanned the rise , reign , and climactic extinction of the huge dinosaurs ; and the Cenozoic , which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on Earth .   Hominins , the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade , rose sometime during the latter part of the Miocene epoch ; the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 mya . The succeeding Quaternary period is the time of recognizable humans , i.e. , the genus Homo , but that period 's two million-year-plus term of the recent times is too small to be visible at the scale of the GTS graphic . -LRB- Notes re the graphic : Ga means `` billion years '' ; Ma , `` million years '' . -RRB-   The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland as well as `` remains of biotic life '' found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , `` If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . ''   Living forms derived from photosynthesis appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today ; and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described .   Geological change has been a constant of Earth 's crust since the time of its formation , and biological change since the first appearance of life .

A member of the Democratic Party , he served in a number of other senior roles , including eighth Vice President -LRB- 1833 -- 37 -RRB- and tenth Secretary of State -LRB- 1829 -- 31 -RRB- , both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson 's policies . Shortly after taking office , the Panic of 1837 struck the nation , and his inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis , combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party , led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election . During his half-century of public service , he built , perfected , and defended a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level . In New York he reorganized the Democratic-Republican Party and established the Albany Regency to keep it in power . He then moved on Washington where he did more than anyone to construct the modern Democratic Party which dominated American politics down to the American Civil War .   A delegate to a political convention at age 18 , he quickly moved from local to state politics , gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer . Elected to the Senate by the New York State Legislature in 1821 , Van Buren supported William H. Crawford for president in the 1824 election , but by 1828 had come to support Jackson . Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election , and ran for Governor of New York in the hope of using his personal popularity to boost Jackson 's campaign . Jackson and Van Buren were elected , and after serving as governor for two months , Van Buren resigned to become Jackson 's Secretary of State . During Jackson 's eight years as president , Van Buren was a key advisor , and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party , particularly in New York . In 1831 , following his resignation as Secretary of State , which aided Jackson in resolving the Petticoat affair , Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as American minister to Britain . Van Buren 's nomination was rejected by the Senate , cutting short his service in London , but he was elected vice president in the 1832 election .   Van Buren faced little opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1835 Democratic National Convention , and he defeated several Whig opponents in the 1836 presidential election . He was the first president to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch ancestry , he is the only president who spoke English as a second language , and was the first not to have a university degree or a military commission . As president , Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837 ; hostile newspapers called him `` Martin Van Ruin '' . He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury , rather than in state banks , but Congress would not approve of this until 1840 . In foreign affairs , he denied the application of Texas for admission to the Union , unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the Missouri Compromise , and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation . Additionally , relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair . In the 1840 election , Van Buren was voted out of office , losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison .   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to James K. Polk , who went on to win the election . In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party . He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse Franklin Pierce -LRB- 1852 -RRB- , James Buchanan -LRB- 1856 -RRB- , and Stephen A. Douglas -LRB- 1860 -RRB- for the presidency . However , his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the American Civil War . Van Buren 's health began to fail in 1861 , and he died in July 1862 at age 79 .

Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation -LRB- particularly of the financial sector -RRB- , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge -LRB- referred to as the `` poll tax '' -RRB- was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher -LRB- of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire -RRB- which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist .

He was the son of Charles , Count of Angoul\u00eame , and Louise of Savoy . He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII , who died without a male heir .   A prodigious patron of the arts , he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , including Leonardo da Vinci , who brought the Mona Lisa with him , which Francis had acquired . Francis ' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France , the spread of humanism and Protestantism , and the beginning of French exploration of the New World . Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire .   For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language , he became known as le P\u00e8re et Restaurateur des Lettres -LRB- the `` Father and Restorer of Letters '' -RRB- . He was also known as Fran\u00e7ois au Grand Nez -LRB- `` Francis of the Large Nose '' -RRB- , the Grand Colas , and the Roi-Chevalier -LRB- the `` Knight-King '' -RRB- for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V.   Following the policy of his predecessors , Francis continued the Italian Wars . The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands , the throne of Spain , and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor , meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy . In his struggle against Imperial hegemony , he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold . When this was unsuccessful , he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent , a controversial move for a Christian king at the time .

Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis -LRB- of which he had been one of the architects -RRB- , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community .   Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth .   Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage .

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -LRB- IPCC -RRB- Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -LRB- UNFCCC -RRB- ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese -LRB- whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions -RRB- among the least concerned .

Return a comma separated list of sentences.\n\nClaim: Folklore includes proverbs.\n\nSource Text: Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people ; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture , subculture or group . These include oral traditions such as tales , proverbs and jokes . They include material culture , ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group . Folklore also includes customary lore , the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings , folk dances and initiation rites . Each one of these , either singly or in combination , is considered a folklore artifact . Just as essential as the form , folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next . For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts . Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration . The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics .   To fully understand folklore , it is helpful to clarify its component parts : the terms folk and lore . It is well-documented that the term was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms . He fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of `` popular antiquities '' or `` popular literature '' . The second half of the compound word , lore , proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries . Coming from Old English l\u0101r ` instruction , ' and with German and Dutch cognates , it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group , frequently passed along by word of mouth .   The concept of folk proves somewhat more elusive . When Thoms first created this term , folk applied only to rural , frequently poor and illiterate peasants . A more modern definition of folk is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits , who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions . `` Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in American folklore or to a single family . '' This expanded social definition of folk supports a broader view of the material , i.e. the lore , considered to be folklore artifacts . These now include all `` things people make with words -LRB- verbal lore -RRB- , things they make with their hands -LRB- material lore -RRB- , and things they make with their actions -LRB- customary lore -RRB- '' . Folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete . The folklorist studies the traditional artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted .   Transmission is a vital part of the folklore process . Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time , they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists . For folklore is also a verb . These folk artifacts continue to be passed along informally , as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants . The folk group is not individualistic , it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community . `` As new groups emerge , new folklore is created ... surfers , motorcyclists , computer programmers '' . In direct contrast to high culture , where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law , folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group .   Having identified folk artifacts , the professional folklorist strives to understand the significance of these beliefs , customs and objects for the group . For these cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group . That meaning can however shift and morph . So Halloween of the 21st century is not the All Hallows ' Eve of the Middle Ages , and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration . The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water ; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew . Compare this to brushing your teeth , also transmitted within a group , which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition . For tradition is initially remembered behavior . Once it loses its practical purpose , there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action . This meaning is at the core of folkloristics , the study of folklore .   With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences , it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group , it is indeed all around us . It does not have to be old or antiquated . It continues to be created , transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between `` us '' and `` them '' .

Bogart began acting in 1921 after a hitch in the U.S. Navy in World War I and little success in various jobs in finance and the production side of the theater . Gradually he became a regular in Broadway shows in the 1920s and 1930s . When the stock market crash of 1929 reduced the demand for plays , Bogart turned to film . His first great success was as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest -LRB- 1936 -RRB- , and this led to a period of typecasting as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces -LRB- 1938 -RRB- .   Bogart 's breakthrough as a leading man came in 1941 with High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon . The next year , his performance in Casablanca -LRB- 1943 ; Oscar nomination -RRB- raised him to the peak of his profession and , at the same time , cemented his trademark film persona , that of the hard-boiled cynic who ultimately shows his noble side . Other successes followed , including To Have and Have Not -LRB- 1944 -RRB- , The Big Sleep -LRB- 1946 -RRB- , Dark Passage -LRB- 1947 -RRB- , and Key Largo -LRB- 1948 -RRB- , all four with his wife Lauren Bacall ; The Treasure of the Sierra Madre -LRB- 1948 -RRB- ; In a Lonely Place -LRB- 1950 -RRB- ; The African Queen -LRB- 1951 ; Oscar winner -RRB- ; Sabrina -LRB- 1954 -RRB- ; The Caine Mutiny -LRB- 1954 ; Oscar nomination -RRB- ; and We 're No Angels -LRB- 1955 -RRB- . His last film was The Harder They Fall -LRB- 1956 -RRB- .   During a film career of almost 30 years , Bogart appeared in more than 75 feature films . In 1999 , the American Film Institute ranked Bogart as the greatest male star of Classic American cinema . Over his career , he received three Academy Award nominations for Best Actor , winning one -LRB- for The African Queen -RRB- .

He founded the religion of Thelema , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the \u00c6on of Horus in the early 20th century . A prolific writer , he published widely over the course of his life .   Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism . He was educated at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry , resulting in several publications . Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life . In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India . He married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honeymooned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who provided him with The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema . Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus , The Book declared that its followers should `` Do what thou wilt '' and seek to align themselves with their True Will through the practice of magick .   After an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga and a visit to India and China , Crowley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature . In 1907 , he and George Cecil Jones co-founded a Thelemite order , the A \u2234 A \u2234 , through which they propagated the religion . After spending time in Algeria , in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order , the German-based Ordo Templi Orientis -LRB- O.T.O. -RRB- , rising to become the leader of its British branch , which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs . Through the O.T.O. , Thelemite groups were established in Britain , Australia , and North America . Crowley spent the First World War in the United States , where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain , later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services . In 1920 he established the Abbey of Thelema , a religious commune in Cefal\u00f9 , Sicily where he lived with various followers . His libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press , and the Italian government evicted him in 1923 . He divided the following two decades between France , Germany , and England , and continued to promote Thelema until his death .   Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime , being a recreational drug experimenter , bisexual and an individualist social critic . He was denounced in the popular press as `` the wickedest man in the world '' and a Satanist . Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter-culture , and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema . In 2002 , a BBC poll ranked him as the seventy-third greatest Briton of all time .

It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior .   Horses ' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .   Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament : spirited `` hot bloods '' with speed and endurance ; `` cold bloods '' , such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow , heavy work ; and `` warmbloods '' , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods , often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes , particularly in Europe . There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today , developed for many different uses .   Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits , as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment , and therapy . Horses were historically used in warfare , from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed , using many different styles of equipment and methods of control . Many products are derived from horses , including meat , milk , hide , hair , bone , and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . Humans provide domesticated horses with food , water and shelter , as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers .

Forceps are used when fingers are too large to grasp small objects or when many objects need to be held at one time while the hands are used to perform a task . The term ` forceps ' is used almost exclusively within the medical field . Outside medicine , people usually refer to forceps as tweezers , tongs , pliers , clips or clamps .   In English ` forceps ' can be used as both the singular and plural form of the word -LRB- example : `` I need a forceps '' -RRB- ; in Latin it is a singular . Also , it is not referred to as a `` pair '' as one refers to a `` pair of scissors '' .   Mechanically , forceps employ the principle of the lever to grasp and apply pressure .   Surgical forceps are commonly made of high-grade carbon steel , which ensures they can withstand repeated sterilization in high-temperature autoclaves . Lower quality steel is used in forceps made for other uses . Some forceps , intended to be used once and then discarded , are made of plastic . The invention of surgical forceps is attributed to Stephen Hales .   There are two basic types of forceps : non-locking -LRB- often called ` thumb forceps ' or ` pick-ups ' -RRB- and locking , though these two types come in dozens of specialized forms for various uses . Non-locking forceps also come in two basic forms : hinged at one end , away from the grasping end -LRB- colloquially such forceps are called tweezers -RRB- and hinged in the middle , rather like scissors . Locking forceps are almost always hinged in the middle , though some forms place the hinge very close to the grasping end . Locking forceps use various means to lock the grasping surfaces in a closed position to facilitate manipulation or to independently clamp , grasp or hold an object .

There are 50 states , which are bound together in a union with each other . Each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory , and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government . Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government , Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons covered by certain types of court orders -LRB- e.g. , paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody -RRB- .   States range in population from just under 600,000 -LRB- Wyoming -RRB- to over 39 million -LRB- California -RRB- , and in area from 1214 sqmi -LRB- Rhode Island -RRB- to 663268 sqmi -LRB- Alaska -RRB- . Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names .   States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state . State governments are allocated power by the people -LRB- of each respective state -RRB- through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches : executive , legislative , and judicial .   States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution ; among them ratifying constitutional amendments . Historically , the tasks of local law enforcement , public education , public health , regulating intrastate commerce , and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities , although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well . Over time , the U.S. Constitution has been amended , and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed . The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation , with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did . There is a continuing debate over states ' rights , which concerns the extent and nature of the states ' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals .   States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is represented in the Senate by two senators , and is guaranteed at least one Representative in the House . Representatives are elected from single-member districts ; seats in the House are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College , the body that elects the President of the United States , equal to the total of representatives and senators from that state .   The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union . Since the establishment of the United States in 1776 , the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 . Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted , both in 1959 .   The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede -LRB- withdraw -RRB- from the Union . Shortly after the Civil War , the U.S. Supreme Court , in Texas v. White , held that a state can not unilaterally do so .

The concerts were held at 2:30 and 8:00 pm on Sunday , 1 August 1971 , at Madison Square Garden in New York City . The shows were organised to raise international awareness and fund relief efforts for refugees from East Pakistan -LRB- now Bangladesh -RRB- , following the Bangladesh Liberation War-related genocide . The concerts were followed by a bestselling live album , a boxed three-record set , and Apple Films ' concert documentary , which opened in cinemas in the spring of 1972 .   The event was the first-ever benefit concert of such a magnitude and featured a supergroup of performers that included Harrison , fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr , Bob Dylan , Eric Clapton , Billy Preston , Leon Russell and the band Badfinger . In addition , Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan -- both of whom had ancestral roots in Bangladesh -- performed an opening set of Indian classical music .

His father , Sir Keith Murdoch , had been a reporter , editor , and senior executive of the Herald and Weekly Times newspaper publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales . After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited . Murdoch thus had full control as Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation , now the world 's second-largest media conglomerate , and its successors , News Corp and 21st Century Fox , after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013 .   In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen -LRB- and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship -RRB- in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , HarperCollins -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , and The Wall Street Journal -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens . Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International . On 1 July 2015 , Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox . Murdoch and his family own both 21st Century Fox and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust .   In July 2016 , after the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment , Murdoch was named the acting CEO of Fox News .

At the time , U.S. senators were elected by state legislatures ; thus Lincoln and Douglas were trying for their respective parties to win control of the Illinois legislature . The debates previewed the issues that Lincoln would face in the aftermath of his victory in the 1860 presidential election . Although Illinois was a free state , the main issue discussed in all seven debates was slavery in the United States .   In agreeing to the official debates , Lincoln and Douglas decided to hold one debate in each of the nine congressional districts in Illinois . Because both had already spoken in two -- Springfield and Chicago -- within a day of each other , they decided that their `` joint appearances '' would be held only in the remaining seven districts .   The debates were held in seven towns in the state of Illinois :  Ottawa on August 21  Freeport on August 27  Jonesboro on September 15  Charleston on September 18  Galesburg on October 7  Quincy on October 13  Alton on October 15   The debates in Freeport , Quincy and Alton drew especially large numbers of people from neighboring states , as the issue of slavery was of monumental importance to citizens across the nation . Newspaper coverage of the debates was intense . Major papers from Chicago sent stenographers to create complete texts of each debate , which newspapers across the United States reprinted in full , with some partisan edits . Newspapers that supported Douglas edited his speeches to remove any errors made by the stenographers and to correct grammatical errors , while they left Lincoln 's speeches in the rough form in which they had been transcribed . In the same way , pro-Lincoln papers edited Lincoln 's speeches , but left the Douglas texts as reported .   After losing the election for Senator in Illinois , Lincoln edited the texts of all the debates and had them published in a book . The widespread coverage of the original debates and the subsequent popularity of the book led eventually to Lincoln 's nomination for President of the United States by the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago .   The format for each debate was : one candidate spoke for 60 minutes , then the other candidate spoke for 90 minutes , and then the first candidate was allowed a 30-minute `` rejoinder . '' The candidates alternated speaking first . As the incumbent , Douglas spoke first in four of the debates . "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Freeport on August 27"}]}

The band consisted of lead vocalist , lead guitarist , and primary songwriter John Fogerty , his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty , bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford . Their musical style encompassed the roots rock , swamp rock , and blues rock genres . Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins , they played in a Southern rock style , with lyrics about bayous , catfish , the Mississippi River , and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography , as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War . The band performed at 1969 's famed Woodstock Festival .   After four years of chart-topping success , the group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 . Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year , and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control , all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits between the former bandmates . Fogerty 's ongoing disagreements with Saul Zaentz , owner of their label Fantasy Records , created further protracted court battles . As a result , John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving former members at CCR 's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   Creedence Clearwater Revival 's music is still a staple of U.S. radio airplay ; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone . Rolling Stone ranked the band 82nd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time .

Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . -LSB- 10 -RSB- -LSB- 12 -RSB- -LSB- 13 -RSB- Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . -LSB- 25 -RSB- The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- 27 -RSB- Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . -LSB- 33 -RSB- Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , -LSB- 34 -RSB- 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . -LSB- 35 -RSB-   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . -LSB- 28 -RSB- From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . -LSB- 29 -RSB- -LSB- 30 -RSB- -LSB- 31 -RSB- -LSB- 32 -RSB- In 2015 Mayor Dana L.

His works have been translated into 27 languages . He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack , which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney . He is a self-proclaimed satirist , whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style . Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common , recurring characters .   Though Ellis made his debut at age 21 with the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles , the work he is most known for is his third novel , American Psycho -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . On its release , the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic . Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year . In later years , Ellis ' novels have become increasingly metafictional . Lunar Park -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews . Imperial Bedrooms -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein .   Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films . Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen , leading to the release of a starkly different film of the same name in 1987 . Mary Harron 's adaptation of American Psycho was released to generally positive reviews in 2000 and went on to achieve cult status . Roger Avary 's 2002 adaptation The Rules of Attraction made modest box office returns but went on to attract a cult following . 2008 's The Informers , based on Ellis 's collection of short stories , was critically panned . Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film The Canyons , an original work .

Although technically a princess of Teck , in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg , she was born and raised in England . Her parents were Francis , Duke of Teck , who was of German extraction , and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , a granddaughter of King George III . She was informally known as `` May '' , after her birth month . At the age of 24 , she was betrothed to Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , the eldest son of the Prince of Wales , but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement , he died unexpectedly of pneumonia . The following year , she became engaged to Albert Victor 's next surviving brother , George , who subsequently became king . Before her husband 's accession , she was successively Duchess of York , Duchess of Cornwall , and Princess of Wales .   As queen consort from 1910 , she supported her husband through World War I , his ill health and major political changes arising from the aftermath of the war , and the rise of socialism and nationalism . After George 's death in 1936 , she became queen mother when her eldest son , Edward , ascended the throne , but to her dismay , he abdicated later the same year in order to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson .

The title refers to the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro , where the film is set . The film features the voices of Jesse Eisenberg , Anne Hathaway , Jemaine Clement , Leslie Mann , George Lopez , and Jamie Foxx . It tells the story of Blu -LRB- Eisenberg -RRB- , a male Spix 's macaw who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix 's macaw , Jewel -LRB- Hathaway -RRB- . The two eventually fall in love , and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel -LRB- Clement -RRB- , a cockatoo . The theme song , `` Telling the World '' was performed by Taio Cruz .   Saldanha developed his first story concept of Rio in 1995 , in which a penguin is washed up in Rio . Saldanha learned of the production of the films Happy Feet -LRB- 2006 -RRB- and Surf 's Up -LRB- 2007 -RRB- , and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio . He proposed his idea to Chris Wedge in 2006 , and the project was set up at Blue Sky . The main voice actors were approached in 2009 . During production , the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the Bronx Zoo to study their movements .   Rio premiered on March 22 , 2011 , in Lagoa , Rio de Janeiro , and had its general release on April 15 , 2011 , in North America . The film received generally positive reviews from film critics . Observers praised the visuals , voice acting , and music . The film was also a box office success , grossing over $ 143 million in the United States and $ 484 million worldwide . The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song `` Real in Rio '' , but lost to the other nominee , `` Man or Muppet '' from The Muppets .

It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam . The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union , China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States , South Korea , Australia , Thailand and other anti-communist allies . The war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war .   The Viet Cong -LRB- also known as the National Liberation Front , or NLF -RRB- , a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North , fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region , while the People 's Army of Vietnam , also known as the North Vietnamese Army -LRB- NVA -RRB- , engaged in more conventional warfare , at times committing large units to battle . As the war continued , the military actions of the Viet Cong decreased as the role and engagement of the NVA grew . U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations , involving ground forces , artillery , and airstrikes . In the course of the war , the U.S. conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam .   The North Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam . They viewed the conflict as a colonial war and a continuation of the First Indochina War against forces from France and later on the United States . The U.S. government viewed its involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam . This was part of the domino theory of a wider containment policy , with the stated aim of stopping the spread of communism worldwide .   Beginning in 1950 , American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina.The Military Assistance Advisory Group , Indochina -LRB- with an authorized strength of 128 men -RRB- was set up in September 1950 with a mission to oversee the use and distribution of US military equipment by the French and their allies . U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s , with troop levels tripling in 1961 and again in 1962 . U.S. involvement escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident , in which a U.S. destroyer clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft , which was followed by the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which gave the U.S. president authorization to increase U.S. military presence . Regular U.S. combat units were deployed beginning in 1965 . Operations crossed international borders : bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were heavily bombed by U.S. forces as American involvement in the war peaked in 1968 , the same year that the communist side launched the Tet Offensive . The Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government , but became the turning point in the war , as it persuaded a large segment of the U.S. population that its government 's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam .   Gradual withdrawal of U.S. ground forces began as part of `` Vietnamization '' , which aimed to end American involvement in the war while transferring the task of fighting the communists to the South Vietnamese themselves . Despite the Paris Peace Accord , which was signed by all parties in January 1973 , the fighting continued . In the U.S. and the Western world , a large anti-Vietnam War movement developed as part of a larger counterculture . The war changed the dynamics between the Eastern and Western Blocs , and altered North -- South relations .   Direct U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 . The capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war , and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year . The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities -LRB- see Vietnam War casualties -RRB- . Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million . Some 240,000 -- 300,000 Cambodians , 20,000 -- 62,000 Laotians , and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict , and a further 1,626 remain missing in action .

During the Cold War , the project expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes , which produced plutonium for most of the more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal . Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period , and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements . Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate , and government documents have confirmed that Hanford 's operations released significant amounts of radioactive materials into the air and the Columbia River .   The weapons production reactors were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War , and decades of manufacturing left behind 53 e6USgal of high-level radioactive waste stored within 177 storage tanks , an additional 25 e6cuft of solid radioactive waste , and 200 sqmi of contaminated groundwater beneath the site . In 2011 , the federal agency charged with overseeing the site , the US Department of Energy -LRB- DOE -RRB- , emptied 149 single-shell tanks by pumping nearly all of the liquid waste out into 28 newer double-shell tanks . DOE later found water intruding into at least 14 single-shell tanks and that one of them had been leaking about 640 USgal per year into the ground since about 2010 . In 2012 , DOE discovered a leak also from a double-shell tank caused by construction flaws and corrosion in the bottom , and that 12 double-shell tanks have similar construction flaws . Since then , DOE changed to monitoring single-shell tanks monthly and double-shell tanks every 3 years , and also changed monitoring methods . In March 2014 , DOE announced further delays in the construction of the Waste Treatment Plant , which will affect the schedule for removing waste from the tanks .  Intermittent discoveries of undocumented contamination have slowed the pace and raised the cost of cleanup .   In 2007 , the Hanford site represented two-thirds of the nation 's high-level radioactive waste by volume . Hanford is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States and is the focus of the nation 's largest environmental cleanup . Besides the cleanup project , Hanford also hosts a commercial nuclear power plant , the Columbia Generating Station , and various centers for scientific research and development , such as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the LIGO Hanford Observatory .   On November 10 , 2015 , it was designated as part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park alongside other sites in Oak Ridge and Los Alamos .
