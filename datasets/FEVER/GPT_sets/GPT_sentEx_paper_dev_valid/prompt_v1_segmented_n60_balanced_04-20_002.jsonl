The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa , meaning `` large water '' or `` large lake '' . Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry .

His father , Sir Keith Murdoch , had been a reporter , editor , and senior executive of the Herald and Weekly Times newspaper publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales . After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited . Murdoch thus had full control as Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation , now the world 's second-largest media conglomerate , and its successors , News Corp and 21st Century Fox , after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013 .   In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen ( and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship ) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens . Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International . On 1 July 2015 , Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox . Murdoch and his family own both 21st Century Fox and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust .   In July 2016 , after the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment , Murdoch was named the acting CEO of Fox News .

After the rejection of his constitutional reform in December 2016 referendum , Renzi formally resigned on 12 December , when Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new head of the government by President Sergio Mattarella . His government is the fourth longest one in the history of Italy as a republic . Renzi served as President of the Province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and as Mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014 .   At the age of 39 years and 42 days upon assuming office , Renzi is the youngest person to serve as Italian Prime Minister ( 52 days younger than Benito Mussolini , who took office in 1922 ) and was the youngest leader in the G7 . He was also the first serving Mayor to become Prime Minister . Renzi was sometimes described as the de facto leader of the Party of European Socialists , in opposition to the European People 's Party associated with Angela Merkel ; the two leaders are together often referred to as Merkenzi . In 2014 the American magazine Fortune ranked Renzi as the third most influential person under 40 in the world ; and Foreign Policy listed him as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers . Moreover , Renzi is nicknamed il Rottamatore ( the Scrapper ) due to his ambition of renovating the Italian political establishment .   While in power Renzi 's Government implemented numerous reforms , including changes to the electoral system , a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth , a thorough reformation of the public administration , the simplification of civil trials , the introduction of same-sex civil unions , and the abolition of many small taxes . \nA constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016 . Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy , as well as the division of powers between the State , the regions , and administrative entities .   The bill , put forward by then - Prime Minister of Italy , Matteo Renzi , and his centre-left Democratic Party , was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014 . After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 ( Senate ) and 11 January 2016 ( Chamber ) , and , eventually , its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 ( Senate ) and 12 April 2016 ( Chamber ) .   In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution , a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote . 59.11 % of voters voted against the constitutional reform , meaning it did not come into effect . This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic ; the other two were in 2001 ( in which the amending law was approved ) and in 2006 ( in which it was rejected ) .   Had the voters approved the constitutional law , it would have achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy since the end of the monarchy , not only influencing the organization of the Parliament , but also improving , according to its proponents , on the poor government stability of the country . Opposition parties harshly criticised the bill , claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful .   Following the clear victory of the `` No '' vote , Renzi tendered his resignation as Prime Minister . Paolo Gentiloni was selected as his replacement on December 11 .

It was created by American Idol producers Simon Fuller and Nigel Lythgoe and is produced by 19 Entertainment , Dick Clark Productions and Conrad Sewell Productions . The series premiered on July 20 , 2005 with over ten million viewers and ended the summer season as the top-rated show on television . The first season was hosted by American news personality Lauren S\u00e1nchez . Since the second season , it has been hosted by former British children 's television personality and game show emcee Cat Deeley . During its second season , the program remained the No. 1 rated summer show ( adults aged 18 -- 49 ) , but it has declined in ratings since .   The show features a tiered format wherein dancers trained in a variety of dance genres enter open auditions held in a number of major U.S. cities to showcase their talents and may move forward through successive additional rounds of auditions to test their ability to adapt to different styles . At the end of this process , a small number of dancers are chosen as finalists . These dancers move on to the competition 's main phase , where they perform solo , duet , and group dance numbers on live television . They compete for the votes of the broadcast viewing audience which , combined with the input of a panel of judges , determines which dancers advance to the next stage from week to week . The number of finalists has varied as determined by a season 's format , but has often been 20 contestants .   Competitors attempt to master various dance styles , including classical , contemporary , ballroom , hip-hop , street , club , jazz , and musical theatre styles , among others . These are usually assigned by a luck-of-the-draw system during the successive weeks of elimination . The eventual champion wins a cash prize ( typically $ 250,000 ) and the title `` America 's Favorite Dancer '' . In thirteen seasons , the winners have been Nick Lazzarini , Benjamin `` Benji '' Schwimmer , Sabra Johnson , Joshua Allen , Jeanine Mason , Russell Ferguson , Lauren Froderman , Melanie Moore , Eliana Girard , Chehon Wespi-Tschopp , Amy Yakima , Du-Shaunt `` Fik-Shun '' Stegall , Ricky Ubeda , Gaby Diaz and Leon `` Kida '' Burns . Girard and Wespi-Tschopp shared the title as dual-winners for the ninth season , and Yakima and Stegall as the winners of the tenth . Since season 7 , finalists have been paired with a So You Think You Can Dance `` All-Star '' as a partner and sometimes a mentor .   The show has won seven Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Choreography and a total of nine Emmy Awards altogether . Licensed variations of the show , produced for broadcast markets in other nations , began airing in August 2005 , and to date 25 localized adaptations of So You Think You Can Dance have been produced in as many countries .   On January 30 , 2017 , Fox renewed the series for a fourteenth season , which returns to its former contestant age range of 18-30 but keeps the All-Star partnerships .

German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront .

The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa , meaning `` large water '' or `` large lake '' . Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry .

Located in the western Pacific Ocean , Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government . The capital city is Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a and the most populous city is Dededo . In 2015 , 161,785 people resided on Guam . Guamanians are American citizens by birth . Guam has an area of 210 sq mi ( 544 km \u00b2 ) and a population density of 770/sq mi ( 297/km \u00b2 ) . It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands and the largest island in Micronesia .

It has the longest documented history of any living language , spanning 34 centuries of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic and many other writing systems .   The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , the Greek language is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , Turkey , and the Greek diaspora .   Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary .

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture 's design and oversaw the project 's execution from 1927-1941 with the help of his son , Lincoln Borglum . Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732 -- 1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743 -- 1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858 -- 1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809 -- 1865 ) . The memorial park covers 1278.45 acre and is 5725 ft above sea level .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on Mount Rushmore , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents .   After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project . Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist . Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and it has appeared in works of fiction , as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million visitors annually . \nJames Lincoln de la Mothe Borglum ( April 9 , 1912 -- January 27 , 1986 ) was an American sculptor , photographer , author and engineer ; he was best known for overseeing the completion of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial after the death in 1941 of the project 's leader , his father , Gutzon Borglum .

Located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean , the city has served as an important port for millennia . , it has a population of 2,425,000 residents .   Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers . These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland ( 1889 -- 1936 ) in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government ( 2004 -- 2012 ) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 . Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction .   As Somalia 's capital city , many important national institutions are based in Mogadishu . It is the seat of the Federal Government of Somalia established in August 2012 , with the Somalia Federal Parliament serving as the government 's legislative branch . Thabit Abdi Mohammed has been the Mayor of Mogadishu since April 2017 . Villa Somalia is the official residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia , Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed . In May 2012 , the First Somali Bank was established in the capital , which organized Mogadishu 's first ever Technology , Entertainment , Design ( TEDx ) conference . The establishment of a local construction yard has also galvanized the city 's real-estate sector . Arba'a Rukun Mosque is one of the oldest Islamic places of worship in the capital , built circa 667 ( 1268/9 AD ) . The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity in Mogadishu is the largest masjid in the Horn region . Mogadishu Cathedral was built in 1928 by the colonial authorities in Italian Somaliland in a Norman Gothic style , and served as the traditional seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio . The National Museum of Somalia is based in Mogadishu and holds many culturally important artefacts . The National Library of Somalia is undergoing a $ 1 million Somali federal government funded renovation , including a new library complex .   Mogadishu is home to a number of scholastic and media institutions . As part of the municipality 's urban renewal program , 100 schools across the capital are scheduled to be refurbished and reopened . The Somali National University ( SNU ) was established in the 1950s , and professors from the university later founded the non-governmental Mogadishu University ( MU ) . Benadir University ( BU ) was established in 2002 with the intention of training doctors . Various national sporting bodies have their headquarters in Mogadishu , including the Somali Football Federation and the Somali Olympic Committee . Mogadishu Stadium was constructed in 1978 during the Siad Barre administration , with the assistance of Chinese engineers . It hosts football matches with teams from the Somali First Division and the Somalia Cup . Additionally , the Port of Mogadishu serves as a major national seaport and is the largest harbour in Somalia .

It has the longest documented history of any living language , spanning 34 centuries of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic and many other writing systems .   The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , the Greek language is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , Turkey , and the Greek diaspora .   Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary .

In the film , Rhys Meyers 's character marries into a wealthy family , but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law 's girlfriend , played by Johansson . The film treats themes of morality , greed , and the roles of lust , money , and luck in life , leading many to compare it to Allen 's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors ( 1989 ) . It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York . The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom . Allen quickly re-wrote the script , which was originally set in New York , for a British setting .   Critics in the United States praised the film and its British setting , and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen . In contrast , reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favourably , finding fault with the locations and especially the idiom of the dialogue . Allen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay .

After several lineup changes in its early years , the band settled on nine members for more than a decade : Corey Taylor , Mick Thomson , Jim Root , Paul Gray , Craig Jones , Sid Wilson , Shawn Crahan , Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison . Gray died on May 24 , 2010 , and was replaced from 2011 -- 2014 by former guitarist Donnie Steele . Jordison left the band on December 12 , 2013 . Steele left during the recording sessions for .5 : The Gray Chapter . The band is now touring with replacement musicians Alessandro Venturella on bass and Jay Weinberg on drums . After the departure of Jordison , the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan ; the other remaining members of Slipknot have been members since the release of the band 's 1999 eponymous debut album .   Slipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image , aggressive style of music , and energetic and chaotic live shows . The band rapidly rose to success following the release of their eponymous debut album in 1999 . The 2001 follow-up album , Iowa , although darker in tone , made the band more popular . After a brief hiatus , Slipknot returned in 2004 with Vol . 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) , before going on another hiatus and returning in 2008 with its fourth album , All Hope Is Gone , which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart .

Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming 's short story `` From a View to a Kill '' , the film has an entirely original screenplay . In A View to a Kill , Bond is pitted against Max Zorin , who plans to destroy California 's Silicon Valley .   The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , who also wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum . It was the third James Bond film to be directed by John Glen , and the last to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny .   Despite receiving a mixed to negative reception by critics , it was a commercial success , with the Duran Duran theme song `` A View to a Kill '' performing well in the charts and earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song . Christopher Walken was also praised for portraying a `` classic Bond villain '' .

Cited by the media as one of India 's influential filmmakers , Mani Ratnam is widely credited with revolutionising the Tamil film industry and altering the profile of Indian cinema . Although working in the mainstream medium , his films are noted for their realism , technical finesse , and craft . The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri , acknowledging his contributions to film in 2002 .   Despite being born into a film family , Mani Ratnam did not develop any interest towards films when he was young . Upon completion of his post graduation in management , he started his career as a consultant . He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film Pallavi Anu Pallavi . The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he was left with fewer offers . However , his fifth directorial outing , Mouna Ragam ( 1986 ) , established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema . He followed that with the Godfatheresque Nayagan ( 1987 ) , which is regarded as a cult film over the years . Mani Ratnam is well known for his `` Political trilogy '' consisting of Roja ( 1992 ) , Bombay ( 1995 ) , and Dil Se . . ( 1998 ) . The commercial and critical success of Roja established him as a leading filmmaker in Indian cinema .   Mani Ratnam is married to Tamil actress Suhasini and has a son with her .

Although technically a princess of Teck , in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg , she was born and raised in England . Her parents were Francis , Duke of Teck , who was of German extraction , and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , a granddaughter of King George III . She was informally known as `` May '' , after her birth month . At the age of 24 , she was betrothed to Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , the eldest son of the Prince of Wales , but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement , he died unexpectedly of pneumonia . The following year , she became engaged to Albert Victor 's next surviving brother , George , who subsequently became king . Before her husband 's accession , she was successively Duchess of York , Duchess of Cornwall , and Princess of Wales .   As queen consort from 1910 , she supported her husband through World War I , his ill health and major political changes arising from the aftermath of the war , and the rise of socialism and nationalism . After George 's death in 1936 , she became queen mother when her eldest son , Edward , ascended the throne , but to her dismay , he abdicated later the same year in order to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . She supported her second son , Albert , who succeeded to the throne as George VI , until his death in 1952 .

It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems . These speech industry players include Google , Microsoft , IBM , Baidu , Apple , Amazon , Nuance , SoundHound , IflyTek , CDAC many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning .

With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her film The Wedding Planner in 2001 , Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week . Her 2002 remix album , J to tha L -- O ! The Remixes , became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 . Following her second divorce , Lopez had a high-profile relationship with Ben Affleck , which strongly influenced her third studio album , This Is Me ...

It was designed by Soren Johnson under the direction of Sid Meier and his video game development studio Firaxis Games . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia , between October 25 and November 4 , 2005 .   Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay , in which the player 's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources . Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC . As with other games in the series , there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game : conquering all other civilizations , controlling a supermajority of the game world 's land and population , building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system , increasing the `` Culture ratings '' of at least three different cities to `` legendary '' levels , or winning a `` World Leader '' popularity contest by the United Nations . If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players , the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner . A large departure from earlier Civilization games is a new graphics engine created from scratch , based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited ( NDL ) .   The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre . Civilization IV has sold 3 million copies and won multiple awards , including several Game of the Year awards . In addition to this , Firaxis Games has also released two major expansions , Civilization IV : Warlords and Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword , as well as the standalone game Civilization IV : Colonization , which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled Sid Meier 's Civilization IV : The Complete Edition .

The stadium was built on the site of Juventus ' and Torino 's former home , the Stadio delle Alpi , and is one of only three club-owned football stadiums in Serie A , alongside Sassuolo 's Mapei Stadium and Udinese 's Stadio Friuli . It was opened at the start of the 2011 -- 12 season and has a capacity of just over 41,000 spectators . The stands are just 7.5 metres from the pitch , a major improvement from the Stadio delle Alpi .   Juventus played the first match against the world 's oldest professional football club Notts County on 8 September 2011 in a friendly which ended 1 -- 1 . Veteran striker Luca Toni found the net after Fabio Quagliarella failed to convert a penalty . The first official competitive match was Juventus -- Parma , played on 11 September 2011 , where Stephan Lichtsteiner scored the stadium 's first goal in the 16th minute . Juventus only lost three matches of their first 100 Italian top-flight league matches at the Juventus Stadium .   The stadium hosted the 2014 UEFA Europa League Final . \nJuventus Football Club S.p.A. ( from Latin iuvent\u016bs , `` youth '' ; [ ju\u02c8v\u025bntus ] ) , colloquially known as Juve ( [ \u02c8ju\u02d0ve ] ) , is a professional Italian association football club based in Turin , Piedmont , founded in 1897 by a group of young Torinese students , among them was their first president Eugenio Canfari and his brother Enrico , author of the company 's historical memory . The club is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section ( 1893 ) , has traditionally worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played its home matches in several grounds , being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Juventus is also the most successful club in Italian football , the one that has the most sporting tradition in the country and one of the most awarded globally having won overall sixty-three official titles on the national and international stage , more than any other club in Italy : a record thirty-three official league titles , a record twelve Coppa Italia titles , a record seven Supercoppa Italiana titles and , with eleven titles in confederation and inter-confederation competitions ( two Intercontinental Cups , two European Champion Clubs ' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup ) it ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won .   Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus initially as a athletics club , it has spent uninterruptedly in the top flight league system ( reformulated as Serie A since 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006 -- 07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family since 1923 to 1943 and since 1947 until the date . The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the ( now-defunct ) Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup ( the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament ) . With its successive triumphs in the Super Cup in 1984 and in the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the club become also the first in the world -- and remains the only one at present -- to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies , an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999 . In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters groups -- often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin -- , it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and abroad , mainly in countries with a significant presence of Italian immigrants , making Juventus a symbol of campanilismo ( `` Anti-parochialism '' ) and italianit\u00e0 ( `` Italianness '' ) along with the club 's tradition of success , some of which have had a significant impact in Italian society , especially in the 1930s and the first post-war decade , as well as the ideological politics and socio-economic origin of the club 's sympathisers and the club 's contribution to the national team -- the most for an Italian club -- , uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football , having performed a decisive role in the Azzurri 's World Cup triumphs of 1934 , 1982 and 2006 .

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper .

After the rejection of his constitutional reform in December 2016 referendum , Renzi formally resigned on 12 December , when Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new head of the government by President Sergio Mattarella . His government is the fourth longest one in the history of Italy as a republic . Renzi served as President of the Province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and as Mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014 .   At the age of 39 years and 42 days upon assuming office , Renzi is the youngest person to serve as Italian Prime Minister ( 52 days younger than Benito Mussolini , who took office in 1922 ) and was the youngest leader in the G7 . He was also the first serving Mayor to become Prime Minister . Renzi was sometimes described as the de facto leader of the Party of European Socialists , in opposition to the European People 's Party associated with Angela Merkel ; the two leaders are together often referred to as Merkenzi . In 2014 the American magazine Fortune ranked Renzi as the third most influential person under 40 in the world ; and Foreign Policy listed him as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers . Moreover , Renzi is nicknamed il Rottamatore ( the Scrapper ) due to his ambition of renovating the Italian political establishment .   While in power Renzi 's Government implemented numerous reforms , including changes to the electoral system , a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth , a thorough reformation of the public administration , the simplification of civil trials , the introduction of same-sex civil unions , and the abolition of many small taxes . \nA constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016 . Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy , as well as the division of powers between the State , the regions , and administrative entities .   The bill , put forward by then - Prime Minister of Italy , Matteo Renzi , and his centre-left Democratic Party , was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014 . After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 ( Senate ) and 11 January 2016 ( Chamber ) , and , eventually , its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 ( Senate ) and 12 April 2016 ( Chamber ) .   In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution , a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote . 59.11 % of voters voted against the constitutional reform , meaning it did not come into effect . This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic ; the other two were in 2001 ( in which the amending law was approved ) and in 2006 ( in which it was rejected ) .   Had the voters approved the constitutional law , it would have achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy since the end of the monarchy , not only influencing the organization of the Parliament , but also improving , according to its proponents , on the poor government stability of the country . Opposition parties harshly criticised the bill , claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful .   Following the clear victory of the `` No '' vote , Renzi tendered his resignation as Prime Minister . Paolo Gentiloni was selected as his replacement on December 11 .

Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard ( its first benefactor ) , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning , and the Harvard Corporation ( formally , the President and Fellows of Harvard College ) is its first chartered corporation . Although never formally affiliated with any denomination , the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869 -- 1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war . The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College .   The university is organized into eleven separate academic units -- ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study -- with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area : its 209 acre main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 mi northwest of Boston ; the business school and athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area . Harvard 's $ 34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution .   Harvard is a large , highly residential research university . The nominal cost of attendance is high , but the university 's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages . It operates several arts , cultural , and scientific museums , alongside the Harvard Library , which is the world 's largest academic and private library system , comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes .  Harvard 's alumni include eight U.S. presidents , several foreign heads of state , 62 living billionaires , 359 Rhodes Scholars , and 242 Marshall Scholars . To date , some 130 Nobel laureates , 18 Fields Medalists , and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students , faculty , or staff .

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .

The second son of Francis I , he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis III , Duke of Brittany , in 1536 .   As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father . Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion .

The Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis ( 1559 ) , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics . France failed to change the balance of power in Europe , as Spain remained the sole dominant power , but it did benefit from the division of the holdings of its ruler , Charles V , and from the weakening of the Holy Roman Empire , which Charles also ruled .

The band 's sound featured his melodic , blues-based guitar lines set against Latin and African rhythms featuring percussion instruments such as timbales and congas not generally heard in rock music . Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades . He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s . In 2003 Rolling Stone magazine listed Santana at number 20 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time . He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards . \nSantana is an American Latin rock band formed in San Francisco , California in 1966 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana . The band first came to widespread public attention when their performance of `` Soul Sacrifice '' at Woodstock in 1969 provided a contrast to other acts on the bill . This exposure helped propel their first album , also named Santana , into a hit , followed in the next two years by the successful Abraxas and Santana III .   In the years that followed , lineup changes were common . Carlos Santana 's increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music , though never quite losing its initial Latin influence .   In 1998 , Santana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , with Carlos Santana , Jose `` Chepito '' Areas , David Brown , Gregg Rolie , Mike Carabello and Michael Shrieve being honored .   The band has earned nine Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards , the latter all in 2000 . Carlos also won a Grammy Award as a solo artist in 1988 . Santana has sold more than 90 million records worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling groups of all time . In 2013 , Santana announced a reunion of the classic line-up for a new record , Santana IV , which was released in April 2016 . They are tied for having the most won Grammys in one night .

He was known for his role as Spock of the Star Trek franchise , a character he portrayed in television and film from a pilot episode shot in late 1964 to his final film performance released in 2013 .   Nimoy began his career in his early twenties , teaching acting classes in Hollywood and making minor film and television appearances through the 1950s , as well as playing the title role in Kid Monk Baroni . Foreshadowing his fame as a semi-alien , he played Narab , one of three Martian invaders , in the 1952 movie serial Zombies of the Stratosphere .   In December 1964 , he made his first appearance in the rejected Star Trek pilot `` The Cage '' , and went on to play the character of Spock until the end of the production run in early 1969 , followed by eight feature films and guest slots in the various spin-off series . The character has had a significant cultural impact and garnered Nimoy three Emmy Award nominations ; TV Guide named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters . After the original Star Trek series , Nimoy starred in Mission : Impossible for two seasons , hosted the documentary series In Search of ... , narrated Civilization IV , and made several well-received stage appearances . He also had a recurring role in the science fiction series Fringe .   Nimoy 's public profile as Spock was so strong that both of his autobiographies , I Am Not Spock ( 1975 ) and I Am Spock ( 1995 ) , were written from the viewpoint of sharing his existence with the character . In 2015 an asteroid was named 4864 Nimoy in his honor .   In September 2016 , For the Love of Spock , a feature-film documentary that covered his life and career , was released . \nSid Meier 's Civilization IV is a turn-based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the Civilization series . It was designed by Soren Johnson under the direction of Sid Meier and his video game development studio Firaxis Games . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia , between October 25 and November 4 , 2005 .   Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay , in which the player 's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources . Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC . As with other games in the series , there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game : conquering all other civilizations , controlling a supermajority of the game world 's land and population , building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system , increasing the `` Culture ratings '' of at least three different cities to `` legendary '' levels , or winning a `` World Leader '' popularity contest by the United Nations . If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players , the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner . A large departure from earlier Civilization games is a new graphics engine created from scratch , based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited ( NDL ) .   The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre . Civilization IV has sold 3 million copies and won multiple awards , including several Game of the Year awards . In addition to this , Firaxis Games has also released two major expansions , Civilization IV : Warlords and Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword , as well as the standalone game Civilization IV : Colonization , which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled Sid Meier 's Civilization IV : The Complete Edition .

With an estimated population of around 15.8 million , it is the most populated state in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n , also known as Guatemala City .   The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved in 1841 .   From the mid to late 19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship .   From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability . As of 2014 , Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the Human Development Index .   Guatemala 's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes a large number of endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica 's designation as a biodiversity hotspot . The country is also known for its rich and distinct culture , which is characterized by a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous influences .

Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .

Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation \u2212 where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment .

He is currently the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock band Angels & Airwaves and was the guitarist , co-lead vocalist and co-founder of the American rock band Blink-182 from 1992 to 2015 . DeLonge grew up in the suburbs of Poway , California , where he embraced skateboarding at an early age . DeLonge received his first guitar shortly thereafter and began writing original punk rock songs . He formed Blink-182 with bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor during his high school years . The band created a following in the mid-1990s through independent releases and relentless touring , particularly in their home country and in Australia . They signed to MCA Records in 1996 and their second album , Dude Ranch ( 1997 ) , featured the hit single `` Dammit '' .   The group encountered bigger success with Enema of the State ( 1999 ) , which featured three hit singles and went quadruple-platinum in the US , eventually selling upwards of 15 million copies worldwide . Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001 's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket . DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer , which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002 , but dissolved the following year . Blink 's eponymous fifth studio album ( 2003 ) reflected a change in tone within the group , which broke up in 2005 following internal tension , spearheaded by DeLonge .   In the aftermath of Blink-182 's breakup , he formed Angels & Airwaves , which has since released five studio albums and has evolved into an `` art project '' , encompassing various forms of media . DeLonge reunited with Blink-182 in 2009 , releasing new music and touring frequently , before parting ways with the band again in 2015 . In addition to his musical career , DeLonge also manages business ventures that he founded : Macbeth Footwear , and technology and design firm Modlife . He helped score and produce the 2011 science fiction film Love , and has multiple film projects in development . He has also expanded into writing , releasing a children 's book , The Lonely Astronaut on Christmas Eve , in 2013 . \nScott William Raynor , Jr. ( born May 23 , 1978 ) is an American musician , best known as the original drummer of the rock band Blink-182 . Born in Poway , California , Raynor first approached the drums in his preteens as a fan of Metallica . He joined Blink-182 at 14 years old and continued with the band ; by the time he was 19 , the group had accumulated a large fan base and a gold record , Dude Ranch . His heavy use of alcohol caused tension in the trio , leading into a fight , eventually leading him to be fired from the band midway through a 1998 tour where Travis Barker replaced him .  Since his departure from the group , Raynor has performed with a wide variety of groups and contributed to the charity StandUp for Kids . \nMark Allan Hoppus ( born March 15 , 1972 ) is an American musician , singer , songwriter , record producer , and television personality best known as the bassist and co-lead vocalist for the pop punk band Blink-182 .   Born in Ridgecrest , California , Hoppus spent his childhood moving back and forth between his mother and father 's houses , as they divorced when he was in third grade . He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high , and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen . After moving to San Diego in 1992 , Hoppus ' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge , and together with drummer Scott Raynor , they formed the band Blink-182 . Following Raynor and DeLonge 's departures from the band in 1998 and 2015 , respectively , Hoppus is now the only remaining founding member of Blink-182 .   Blink-182 produced several rock recordings and toured exhaustively before signing to major label MCA to co-distribute their sophomore effort , 1997 's Dude Ranch , which featured the Hoppus-penned hit `` Dammit '' . After replacing Raynor with Travis Barker , the trio recorded Enema of the State ( 1999 ) , which launched the band into multiplatinum success , becoming the biggest pop punk act of the era . Two more records followed -- the heavier Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( 2001 ) and the more experimental Blink-182 ( 2003 ) -- before the band split in 2005 following internal tension . Hoppus continued playing with Barker in +44 in the late 2000s . Blink-182 subsequently reunited in 2009 and continue to record and tour worldwide .   Aside from his musical career , Hoppus has had multiple successes behind the recording console , producing records for groups such as Idiot Pilot , New Found Glory , The Matches , Motion City Soundtrack and PAWS . He has previously co-owned two companies , Atticus and Macbeth Footwear , and has begun a clothing line named Hi My Name is Mark . Hoppus hosted a weekly podcast in 2005 through 2006 which returned in 2015 , and he hosted his own television talk show , Hoppus on Music , from 2010 to 2012 on Fuse .

His works have been translated into 27 languages . He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack , which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney . He is a self-proclaimed satirist , whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style . Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common , recurring characters .   Though Ellis made his debut at age 21 with the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero ( 1985 ) , a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles , the work he is most known for is his third novel , American Psycho ( 1991 ) . On its release , the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic . Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year . In later years , Ellis ' novels have become increasingly metafictional . Lunar Park ( 2005 ) , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews . Imperial Bedrooms ( 2010 ) , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein .   Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films . Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen , leading to the release of a starkly different film of the same name in 1987 . Mary Harron 's adaptation of American Psycho was released to generally positive reviews in 2000 and went on to achieve cult status . Roger Avary 's 2002 adaptation The Rules of Attraction made modest box office returns but went on to attract a cult following . 2008 's The Informers , based on Ellis 's collection of short stories , was critically panned . Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film The Canyons , an original work .

He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 .   Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .   Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design . In The Blind Watchmaker ( 1986 ) , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms . Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer . In The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion . He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools .   Dawkins has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television , radio and Internet appearances , predominantly discussing his books , his atheism , and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual .

She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels , The Vampire Chronicles , revolving around the central character of Lestat . Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations , Interview with the Vampire in 1994 , and Queen of the Damned in 2002 .   Born in New Orleans , Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas , and later to San Francisco . She was raised in an observant Catholic family , but became an agnostic as a young adult . She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to [ her ] life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .   In addition to her vampire novels , Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints ( adapted for television in 2001 ) and Servant of the Bones , which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries . Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers . Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure , including Exit to Eden , which was later adapted into a 1994 film .

Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard 's previous group Mother Love Bone , the two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder , guitarist Mike McCready , and drummer Dave Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990 . Most of the songs began as instrumental jams , to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression , homelessness , and abuse .   Ten was not an immediate success , but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart . The album produced three hit singles : `` Alive '' , `` Even Flow '' , and `` Jeremy '' . While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time -- despite the fact that Ten had been both recorded and released before Nirvana 's Nevermind -- Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream . In February 2013 , the album crossed the 10 million mark in sales , becoming the 22nd one to do so in the Nielsen SoundScan era and has been certified 13x platinum by the RIAA . It remains Pearl Jam 's most commercially successful album . \nPearl Jam is an American rock band formed in Seattle , Washington , in 1990 . Since its inception , the band 's line-up has comprised Eddie Vedder ( lead vocals ) , Mike McCready ( lead guitar ) , Stone Gossard ( rhythm guitar ) and Jeff Ament ( bass ) . The band 's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron ( also of Soundgarden ) , who has been with the band since 1998 . Boom Gaspar ( piano ) has also been a session/touring member with the band since 2002 . Drummers Dave Krusen , Matt Chamberlain , Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons are former members of the band .   Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament 's previous band , Mother Love Bone , Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album , Ten , in 1991 . One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s , over the course of the band 's career , its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices , including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews , and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster . In 2006 , Rolling Stone described the band as having `` spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame . ''   To date , the band has sold nearly 32million records in the United States and an estimated 60million worldwide . Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s , and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as `` the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s '' .

Built of concrete and sand , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian ( 81 -- 96 ) . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name ( Flavius ) .   The Colosseum could hold , it is estimated , between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators , having an average audience of some 65,000 ; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles ( for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities ) , animal hunts , executions , re-enactments of famous battles , and dramas based on Classical mythology . The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era . It was later reused for such purposes as housing , workshops , quarters for a religious order , a fortress , a quarry , and a Christian shrine .   Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers , the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome . It is one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church , as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit `` Way of the Cross '' procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum .   The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin .   The Colosseum 's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium , often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre . The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty , following the reign of Nero . This name is still used in modern English , but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum . In antiquity , Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum ( with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar ) , but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum ; Vespasian and Titus , builders of the Colosseum , also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) .   The name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby ( the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes ) . This statue was later remodeled by Nero 's successors into the likeness of Helios ( Sol ) or Apollo , the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . Nero 's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors . Despite its pagan links , the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers . It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome .   In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colis\u00e6us , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus ( `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' ) . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus ( as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ) . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre .   The Colossus did eventually fall , possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze . By the year 1000 the name `` Colosseum '' had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre . The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives , situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma .   The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages . In Italy , the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo , and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul ( Romanian ) , le Colis\u00e9e ( French ) , el Coliseo ( Spanish ) and o Coliseu ( Portuguese ) .

It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula , in the geographical centre of Denmark , 187 km northwest of Copenhagen and 289 km north of Hamburg , Germany . The inner urban area contains 269,022 inhabitants and the municipal population is 335,684 . Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area , which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016 .   The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948 . The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products . Market town privileges were granted in 1441 , but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars . In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction .

( October 10 , 1924 -- December 10 , 1978 ) was an American filmmaker , actor , writer , producer , and director .   In the 1950s , Wood made a number of low-budget films in the science fiction , comedy , and horror genres , intercutting stock footage . In the 1960s and 1970s , he made sexploitation movies and wrote over 80 pulp crime , horror and sex novels . In 1980 , he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time , renewing public interest in his work . Wood 's career and camp approach has earned him and his films a cult following .   Following the publication of Rudolph Grey 's 1992 oral biography Nightmare of Ecstasy : The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood , Jr. , Wood 's life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of sorts , leading up to director Tim Burton 's biopic of Wood 's life , Ed Wood ( 1994 ) , a critically acclaimed film starring Johnny Depp as Wood that earned two Academy Awards . \nEd Wood is a 1994 American biographical period comedy-drama film directed and produced by Tim Burton , and starring Johnny Depp as cult filmmaker Ed Wood . The film concerns the period in Wood 's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi , played by Martin Landau . Sarah Jessica Parker , Patricia Arquette , Jeffrey Jones , Lisa Marie , and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast .   The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts . Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel , Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic , and Michael Lehmann as director . Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads , Lehmann had to vacate the director 's position , which was taken over by Burton .   Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures , but the studio put the film in `` turnaround '' over Burton 's decision to shoot in black-and-white . Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios , which produced the film through the studio 's Touchstone Pictures division . The film was released to critical acclaim , but was a box office bomb , making only $ 5.9 million against an $ 18 million budget . It won two Academy Awards : Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker ( who designed Landau 's prosthetic makeup ) , Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng .

Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard ( its first benefactor ) , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning , and the Harvard Corporation ( formally , the President and Fellows of Harvard College ) is its first chartered corporation . Although never formally affiliated with any denomination , the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869 -- 1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war . The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College .   The university is organized into eleven separate academic units -- ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study -- with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area : its 209 acre main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 mi northwest of Boston ; the business school and athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area . Harvard 's $ 34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution .   Harvard is a large , highly residential research university . The nominal cost of attendance is high , but the university 's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages . It operates several arts , cultural , and scientific museums , alongside the Harvard Library , which is the world 's largest academic and private library system , comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes .  Harvard 's alumni include eight U.S. presidents , several foreign heads of state , 62 living billionaires , 359 Rhodes Scholars , and 242 Marshall Scholars . To date , some 130 Nobel laureates , 18 Fields Medalists , and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students , faculty , or staff .

It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir .

After the rejection of his constitutional reform in December 2016 referendum , Renzi formally resigned on 12 December , when Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new head of the government by President Sergio Mattarella . His government is the fourth longest one in the history of Italy as a republic . Renzi served as President of the Province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and as Mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014 .   At the age of 39 years and 42 days upon assuming office , Renzi is the youngest person to serve as Italian Prime Minister ( 52 days younger than Benito Mussolini , who took office in 1922 ) and was the youngest leader in the G7 . He was also the first serving Mayor to become Prime Minister . Renzi was sometimes described as the de facto leader of the Party of European Socialists , in opposition to the European People 's Party associated with Angela Merkel ; the two leaders are together often referred to as Merkenzi . In 2014 the American magazine Fortune ranked Renzi as the third most influential person under 40 in the world ; and Foreign Policy listed him as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers . Moreover , Renzi is nicknamed il Rottamatore ( the Scrapper ) due to his ambition of renovating the Italian political establishment .   While in power Renzi 's Government implemented numerous reforms , including changes to the electoral system , a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth , a thorough reformation of the public administration , the simplification of civil trials , the introduction of same-sex civil unions , and the abolition of many small taxes . \nA constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016 . Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy , as well as the division of powers between the State , the regions , and administrative entities .   The bill , put forward by then - Prime Minister of Italy , Matteo Renzi , and his centre-left Democratic Party , was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014 . After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 ( Senate ) and 11 January 2016 ( Chamber ) , and , eventually , its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 ( Senate ) and 12 April 2016 ( Chamber ) .   In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution , a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote . 59.11 % of voters voted against the constitutional reform , meaning it did not come into effect . This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic ; the other two were in 2001 ( in which the amending law was approved ) and in 2006 ( in which it was rejected ) .   Had the voters approved the constitutional law , it would have achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy since the end of the monarchy , not only influencing the organization of the Parliament , but also improving , according to its proponents , on the poor government stability of the country . Opposition parties harshly criticised the bill , claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful .   Following the clear victory of the `` No '' vote , Renzi tendered his resignation as Prime Minister . Paolo Gentiloni was selected as his replacement on December 11 .

They are classified as part of the Austronesian family , belonging to the Oceanic branch of that family . Polynesians share many unique cultural traits that resulted from about 1000 years of common development , including common linguistic development , in the Tonga and S\u0101moa area through most of the first millennium BC .   There are approximately forty Polynesian languages . The most prominent of these are Tahitian , S\u0101moan , Tongan , M\u0101ori and Hawaiian . Because the Polynesian islands were settled relatively recently and because internal linguistic diversification only began around 2,000 years ago , their languages retain strong commonalities . There are still many cognate words across the different islands e.g. tapu , ariki , motu , kava ( Kava culture ) , and tapa as well as Hawaiki , the mythical homeland for some of the cultures .   All Polynesian languages show strong similarity , particularly in vocabulary . The vowels are often stable in the descendant languages , nearly always a , e , i , o and u . The legendary homeland of the M\u0101ori of New Zealand , where w is used instead of v , is called Hawaiki ; in the Cook Islands , where h is replaced with the glottal stop , it is ` Avaiki ; in the Hawaiian Islands , where w is used and k is replaced with the glottal stop , the largest island of the group is named Hawai`i ; in S\u0101moa , where s has not been replaced by h , v is used instead of w , and k is replaced with the glottal stop , the largest island is called Savai'i . In the Society Islands , k and ng are replaced by the glottal stop , so the name for the ancestral homeland is pronounced Havai`i .

He was the oldest son of Henry I the Fowler and Matilda .   Otto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father 's death in 936 . He continued his father 's work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king 's powers at the expense of the aristocracy . Through strategic marriages and personal appointments , Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom 's most important duchies . This reduced the various dukes , who had previously been co-equals with the king , to royal subjects under his authority . Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen royal authority and subjected its clergy to his personal control .   After putting down a brief civil war among the rebellious duchies , Otto defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 , thus ending the Hungarian invasions of Western Europe . The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto a reputation as a savior of Christendom and secured his hold over the kingdom . By 961 , Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy and extended his realm 's borders to the north , east , and south . The patronage of Otto and his immediate successors facilitated a so-called `` Ottonian Renaissance '' of arts and architecture . Following the example of Charlemagne 's coronation as `` Emperor of the Romans '' in 800 , Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962 by Pope John XII in Rome .   Otto 's later years were marked by conflicts with the papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy . Reigning from Rome , Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire , which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm 's further expansion to the south . To resolve this conflict , the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son Otto II in April 972 . Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in May 973 . Otto II succeeded him as Holy Roman Emperor .

A member of the Democratic Party , he served in a number of other senior roles , including eighth Vice President ( 1833 -- 37 ) and tenth Secretary of State ( 1829 -- 31 ) , both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson 's policies . Shortly after taking office , the Panic of 1837 struck the nation , and his inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis , combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party , led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election . During his half-century of public service , he built , perfected , and defended a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level . In New York he reorganized the Democratic-Republican Party and established the Albany Regency to keep it in power . He then moved on Washington where he did more than anyone to construct the modern Democratic Party which dominated American politics down to the American Civil War .   A delegate to a political convention at age 18 , he quickly moved from local to state politics , gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer . Elected to the Senate by the New York State Legislature in 1821 , Van Buren supported William H. Crawford for president in the 1824 election , but by 1828 had come to support Jackson . Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election , and ran for Governor of New York in the hope of using his personal popularity to boost Jackson 's campaign . Jackson and Van Buren were elected , and after serving as governor for two months , Van Buren resigned to become Jackson 's Secretary of State . During Jackson 's eight years as president , Van Buren was a key advisor , and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party , particularly in New York . In 1831 , following his resignation as Secretary of State , which aided Jackson in resolving the Petticoat affair , Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as American minister to Britain . Van Buren 's nomination was rejected by the Senate , cutting short his service in London , but he was elected vice president in the 1832 election .   Van Buren faced little opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1835 Democratic National Convention , and he defeated several Whig opponents in the 1836 presidential election . He was the first president to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch ancestry , he is the only president who spoke English as a second language , and was the first not to have a university degree or a military commission . As president , Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837 ; hostile newspapers called him `` Martin Van Ruin '' . He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury , rather than in state banks , but Congress would not approve of this until 1840 . In foreign affairs , he denied the application of Texas for admission to the Union , unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the Missouri Compromise , and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation . Additionally , relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair . In the 1840 election , Van Buren was voted out of office , losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison .   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to James K. Polk , who went on to win the election . In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party . He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse Franklin Pierce ( 1852 ) , James Buchanan ( 1856 ) , and Stephen A. Douglas ( 1860 ) for the presidency . However , his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the American Civil War . Van Buren 's health began to fail in 1861 , and he died in July 1862 at age 79 .

It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals ( prosigns ) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character ( letter or numeral ) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots ( one dash ) , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty .

The club 's home for the 2017-18 season will be Wembley Stadium , as their former home of White Hart Lane is being dismantled to make way for a completely new rebuilt stadium on the same site . Their newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield .   Founded in 1882 , Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901 , making them the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888 . Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double , winning both competitions in the 1960 -- 61 season . After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962 , in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition -- the European Cup Winners ' Cup . In 1967 , Spurs won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s . In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and were the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972 , becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies . In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies : the FA Cup twice , FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984 . In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup . When they won the League Cup once more in 2008 , it meant that they had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades -- an achievement only matched by Manchester United .   The club 's Latin motto is Audere est Facere ( lit : `` To Dare Is to Do '' ) , and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football . The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby neighbours Arsenal , with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby . \nThe EFL Cup , or simply the League Cup , is an annual knockout football competition in men 's domestic English football . Organised by the English Football League ( EFL ) , it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system -- 92 clubs in total -- comprising the top level Premier League , and the three divisions of the English Football League 's own league competition ( Championship , League One and League Two ) .   First held in 1960 -- 61 as the Football League Cup , it is one of the three top domestic football competitions in England , alongside the Premier League and FA Cup . It concludes in February , long before the other two , which end in May . It was introduced by the league as a response to the growing popularity of European football , and to also exert power over the FA . It also took advantage of the roll-out of floodlights , allowing the fixtures to be played as midweek evening games . With the renaming of the Football League as the English Football League in 2016 , the tournament was rebranded as the EFL Cup from the 2016 -- 17 season onwards .   The tournament is played over seven rounds , with single leg ties throughout , except the semi-finals . The final is held at Wembley Stadium ; it is the only tie in the competition played at a neutral venue and on a weekend ( Sunday ) . Entrants are seeded in the early rounds , and a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds , and to defer the entry of teams still involved in Europe . Winners receive the EFL Cup , of which there have been three designs , the current one also being the original . Winners also qualify for European football with a place in the UEFA Europa League -- although this place is transferred to the highest-placed Premier League team not already qualified for European competition , should the winner also qualify for Europe through other means at the end of the season . The current holders are Manchester United , who beat Southampton 3 -- 2 in the 2017 final to win their fifth League Cup . \nThe FA Cup is an annual knockout football competition in men 's domestic English football . First played during the 1871 -- 72 season , it is the oldest association football competition in the world . It is organised by and named after The Football Association ( The FA ) . For sponsorship reasons , from 2015 through to 2018 it is also known as The Emirates FA Cup . A concurrent women 's tournament is also held , the FA Women 's Cup .   The competition is open to any eligible club down to Level 10 of the English football league system -- all 92 professional clubs in the Premier League ( Level 1 ) and the English Football League ( Levels 2 to 4 ) , and several hundred `` non-league '' teams in Steps 1 to 6 of the National League System ( Levels 5 to 10 ) . A record 763 clubs competed in 2011 -- 12 . The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final . Entrants are not seeded , although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds -- the minimum number of games needed to win the competition ranges from six to fourteen .   The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition , from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper , meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two . The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs , into the draw for the Third Round Proper . In the modern era , only one non-league team has ever reached the quarter finals , and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.Since 1920 , when the Football League expanded to three divisions , no club from outside the top two divisions has reached the final . Since 1914 , when QPR reached the fourth round proper ( the last eight/quarter-final stage ) , the only non-league club to have reached that stage is Lincoln City in 2017 . As a result , as well as who wins , significant focus is given to those `` minnows '' ( smaller teams ) who progress furthest , especially if they achieve an unlikely `` giant-killing '' victory .   Winners receive the FA Cup trophy , of which there have been two designs and five actual cups ; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design , introduced in 1911 . Winners also qualify for the Europa League and a place in the FA Community Shield match . Arsenal are the current holders , having beaten Chelsea 2 -- 1 in the 2017 final to win the cup for the 13th time in their history and become the tournament 's most successful club . Arsenal 's Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the most successful manager in the competition , with seven finals won .

He founded the religion of Thelema , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the \u00c6on of Horus in the early 20th century . A prolific writer , he published widely over the course of his life .   Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism . He was educated at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry , resulting in several publications . Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life . In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India . He married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honeymooned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who provided him with The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema . Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus , The Book declared that its followers should `` Do what thou wilt '' and seek to align themselves with their True Will through the practice of magick .   After an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga and a visit to India and China , Crowley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature . In 1907 , he and George Cecil Jones co-founded a Thelemite order , the A \u2234 A \u2234 , through which they propagated the religion . After spending time in Algeria , in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order , the German-based Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) , rising to become the leader of its British branch , which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs . Through the O.T.O. , Thelemite groups were established in Britain , Australia , and North America . Crowley spent the First World War in the United States , where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain , later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services . In 1920 he established the Abbey of Thelema , a religious commune in Cefal\u00f9 , Sicily where he lived with various followers . His libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press , and the Italian government evicted him in 1923 . He divided the following two decades between France , Germany , and England , and continued to promote Thelema until his death .   Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime , being a recreational drug experimenter , bisexual and an individualist social critic . He was denounced in the popular press as `` the wickedest man in the world '' and a Satanist . Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter-culture , and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema . In 2002 , a BBC poll ranked him as the seventy-third greatest Briton of all time .

He is currently the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock band Angels & Airwaves and was the guitarist , co-lead vocalist and co-founder of the American rock band Blink-182 from 1992 to 2015 . DeLonge grew up in the suburbs of Poway , California , where he embraced skateboarding at an early age . DeLonge received his first guitar shortly thereafter and began writing original punk rock songs . He formed Blink-182 with bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor during his high school years . The band created a following in the mid-1990s through independent releases and relentless touring , particularly in their home country and in Australia . They signed to MCA Records in 1996 and their second album , Dude Ranch ( 1997 ) , featured the hit single `` Dammit '' .   The group encountered bigger success with Enema of the State ( 1999 ) , which featured three hit singles and went quadruple-platinum in the US , eventually selling upwards of 15 million copies worldwide . Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001 's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket . DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer , which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002 , but dissolved the following year . Blink 's eponymous fifth studio album ( 2003 ) reflected a change in tone within the group , which broke up in 2005 following internal tension , spearheaded by DeLonge .   In the aftermath of Blink-182 's breakup , he formed Angels & Airwaves , which has since released five studio albums and has evolved into an `` art project '' , encompassing various forms of media . DeLonge reunited with Blink-182 in 2009 , releasing new music and touring frequently , before parting ways with the band again in 2015 . In addition to his musical career , DeLonge also manages business ventures that he founded : Macbeth Footwear , and technology and design firm Modlife . He helped score and produce the 2011 science fiction film Love , and has multiple film projects in development . He has also expanded into writing , releasing a children 's book , The Lonely Astronaut on Christmas Eve , in 2013 .

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica , although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty .   The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .   Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing . The regime , headed by Augusto Pinochet , ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010 .   Chile is today one of South America 's most stable and prosperous nations . It leads Latin American nations in rankings of human development , competitiveness , income per capita , globalization , state of peace , economic freedom , and low perception of corruption . It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state , and democratic development .

German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront .

The film concerns the period in Wood 's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi , played by Martin Landau . Sarah Jessica Parker , Patricia Arquette , Jeffrey Jones , Lisa Marie , and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast .   The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts . Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel , Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic , and Michael Lehmann as director . Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads , Lehmann had to vacate the director 's position , which was taken over by Burton .   Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures , but the studio put the film in `` turnaround '' over Burton 's decision to shoot in black-and-white . Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios , which produced the film through the studio 's Touchstone Pictures division . The film was released to critical acclaim , but was a box office bomb , making only $ 5.9 million against an $ 18 million budget . It won two Academy Awards : Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker ( who designed Landau 's prosthetic makeup ) , Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng .

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher ( of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire ) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist .

Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability , a trait that earned him his nickname `` The Iron Horse '' . He was an All-Star seven consecutive times , a Triple Crown winner once , an American League ( AL ) Most Valuable Player twice , and a member of six World Series champion teams . He had a career .340 batting average , .632 slugging average , and a .447 on base average . He hit 493 home runs and had 1,995 runs batted in ( RBI ) . In 1939 , he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number ( 4 ) retired by a team .   A native of New York City and attendee of Columbia University , Gehrig signed with the Yankees in 1923 . He set several major league records during his career , including the most career grand slams ( 23 ) ( since broken by Alex Rodriguez ) and most consecutive games played ( 2,130 ) , a record that stood for 56 years and was long considered unbreakable until surpassed by Cal Ripken , Jr. in 1995 . Gehrig 's streak ended on May 2 , 1939 , when he voluntarily took himself out of the lineup to stunned fans after his play was hampered by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , an incurable neuromuscular disorder now commonly referred to in North America as Lou Gehrig 's disease . The disease forced him to retire at age 36 and was the cause of his death two years later . The pathos of his farewell from baseball was capped off by his iconic 1939 `` Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth '' speech at Yankee Stadium .   Gehrig was voted the greatest first baseman of all time by the Baseball Writers ' Association in 1969 , and was the leading vote-getter on the Major League Baseball All-Century Team chosen by fans in 1999 . A monument in Gehrig 's honor , originally dedicated by the Yankees in 1941 , currently resides in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium .

His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the ways the five-string banjo had been historically played . He popularized the instrument in several genres of music and elevated the banjo from its role as a background rhythm instrument , or a comedian 's prop , into featured solo status .   Scruggs ' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in a group called `` Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys '' . The name `` bluegrass '' stuck and eventually became the eponym for this entire genre of county music . Despite considerable success with Monroe , performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits like `` Blue Moon of Kentucky '' , Scruggs gave notice in 1946 that he was quitting the band because of the exhausting touring schedule . Band member Lester Flatt resigned as well , and Flatt and Scruggs later paired up in a new group they called `` Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys '' . Scruggs ' banjo instrumental called `` Foggy Mountain Breakdown '' , released in 1949 , became an enduring hit , and had a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde . The song won two Grammy Awards and in 2005 was selected for the Library of Congress ' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit .   Flatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit , `` The Ballad of Jed Clampett '' . This song was the theme music for the successful network television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies and was the first bluegrass recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts . Over their 20-year association , Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records . The duo broke up in 1969 , chiefly because Scruggs wanted to progress the music to a more modern sound and Flatt was a traditionalist who did not want to change the style because he thought it would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists . Each of them formed a new band that matched his own vision , but neither of them ever regained the success they achieved as a team .   Scruggs received four Grammy awards , a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts . He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood walk of fame . In 1985 , Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named number 24 as a duo on CMT 's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music . Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts ; the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the US . Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the Grammy Hall of Fame . After Scruggs ' death in 2012 at age 88 , the Earl Scruggs Center was founded near his birthplace in Shelby , North Carolina , with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors . The center is a $ 5.5 million facility which features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students .

Directed by Spike Lee , the film stars Derek Luke , Michael Ealy , Laz Alonso , Omar Benson Miller , Pierfrancesco Favino and Valentina Cervi . Set primarily in Italy during German-occupied Europe in World War II , the film tells the story of four Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division who seek refuge in a small Tuscan village , where they form a bond with the residents . The story is presented as a flashback , as one survivor reflects upon his experiences in a frame story set in 1980s New York . Several real-life events that occurred during the war , such as the Sant ` Anna di Stazzema massacre , are re-enacted , placing Miracle at St. Anna within the genre of historical fiction .   Lee first learned of the novel in 2004 and approached McBride with the idea of a film adaptation . In Europe , the film 's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini , who helped finance the $ 45 million production . A majority of the film was shot in Italy , on several locations affected by World War II . Other filming locations included New York , Louisiana and The Bahamas . Frequent Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard composed the score , and the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic .   Miracle at St. Anna premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival before it was released on September 26 , 2008 . It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies . During its theatrical run , Miracle at St. Anna was a box office disappointment , grossing only $ 9.3 million worldwide .

The English identity is of early medieval origin , when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn ( `` family of the Angles '' ) . Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles , one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD . England is one of the countries of the United Kingdom .   Historically , the English population is descended from several peoples -- the earlier Britons ( or Brythons ) and the Germanic tribes that settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans , including Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become England ( from the Old English Englaland ) along with the later Danes , Normans and other groups . In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England was succeeded by the Kingdom of Great Britain . Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general .   Today many English people have recent forebears from other parts of the United Kingdom , while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other European countries and from the Commonwealth .   The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis . These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire .

Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper .

The country is made of three historical regions , Tripolitania , Fezzan and Cyrenaica . With an area of almost 1.8 e6km2 , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa , and is the 16th largest country in the world . Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world .   The largest city and capital , Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya 's six million people . The other large city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya .   Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age . The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya , and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya . Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire . Libya was an early centre of Christianity . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century , when invasions brought Islam and Arab colonisation . In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 . Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries . Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943 . During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign . The Italian population then went into decline . Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951 .   A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I , beginning a period of sweeping social reform . The most prominent coup figure , Muammar Gaddafi , was ultimately able to have power fully concentrated in his hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution , remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011 , fought by those supporting the government and by forces attempting to overthrow it , in which the rebels were supported by NATO . Since then , Libya has experienced a period of instability . The European Union is involved in an operation intended to disrupt human trafficking networks exploiting refugees fleeing from wars in Africa for Europe .   As part of the ongoing second Libyan Civil War ( 2014 -- present ) , at least two political bodies claim to be the government of Libya . The Council of Deputies is one such government , but it does not hold territory in the capital , Tripoli , instead meeting in the Cyrenaica city of Tobruk . Meanwhile , the UN-backed 2014 General National Congress purports to be the legal continuation of the General National Congress , elected in the 2012 Libyan General National Congress election and dissolved following the June 2014 elections but then reconvened by a minority of its members . The Supreme Court in the Libya Dawn and General National Congress-controlled Tripoli declared the Tobruk government unconstitutional in November 2014 , but the body has rejected the ruling as made under threat of violence .   Parts of Libya are outside of either government 's control , with various Islamist , rebel , and tribal militias administering some cities and areas . The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between the Tobruk - and Tripoli-based factions . An agreement to form a unified interim government was signed on 17 December 2015 . Under the terms of the agreement , a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would be formed , with a view to holding new elections within two years . The leaders of the new government , called the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) , arrived in Tripoli on 5 April 2016 . Since then the GNC , one of the two rival governments , has disbanded to support the new GNA .

Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common . ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life . The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50 . The average survival from onset to death is two to four years . About 10 % survive longer than 10 years . Most die from respiratory failure . In much of the world , rates of ALS are unknown . In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year .   Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell . In 1869 , the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot , who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking , diagnosed in 1963 and expected to die within two years , became famous . In 2014 , videos of the ice bucket challenge went viral on the World Wide Web and increased public awareness of the condition .

She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels , The Vampire Chronicles , revolving around the central character of Lestat . Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations , Interview with the Vampire in 1994 , and Queen of the Damned in 2002 .   Born in New Orleans , Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas , and later to San Francisco . She was raised in an observant Catholic family , but became an agnostic as a young adult . She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to [ her ] life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .   In addition to her vampire novels , Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints ( adapted for television in 2001 ) and Servant of the Bones , which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries . Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers . Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure , including Exit to Eden , which was later adapted into a 1994 film .

The Islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark . Its area is about 1,400 km2 with a population of 50,030 in April 2017 .   The land of the Faeroes is rugged , and these islands have a subpolar oceanic climate ( Cfc ) : windy , wet , cloudy , and cool . Despite this island group 's northerly latitude , temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream .   Between 1035 and 1814 , the Faeroes were part of the Hereditary Kingdom of Norway . In 1814 , the Treaty of Kiel granted Denmark control over the islands , along with two other Norwegian island possessions : Greenland and Iceland . The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948 . The Faroese have control of most domestic matters . Areas that remain the responsibility of Denmark include military defence , the police department , the justice department , currency , and foreign affairs . However , as they are not part of the same customs area as Denmark , the Faroe Islands have an independent trade policy , and can establish trade agreements with other states . The islands also have representation in the Nordic Council as members of the Danish delegation . The people of the Faroe Islands also compete as a national team in certain sports .

The word `` monster '' derives from Latin monstrum , meaning an aberrant occurrence , usually biological , that was taken as a sign that something was wrong within the natural order .   The word usually connotes something wrong or evil ; a monster is generally morally objectionable , physically or psychologically hideous , or a freak of nature . It can also be applied figuratively to a person with similar characteristics like a greedy person or a person who does horrible things .   The root of monstrum is monere -- which does not only mean to warn but also to instruct , and forms the basis of the modern English demonstrate . Thus , the monster is also a sign or instruction . This benign interpretation was proposed by Saint Augustine , who did not see the monster as inherently evil , but as part of the natural design of the world , a kind-of deliberate category error .   Well known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula , Frankenstein 's monster , werewolves , mummies , and zombies , to name a few .

It is the sixth main entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of crossover games . Like previous installments , players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles . Infinite features two-on-two fights , as opposed to the three-on-three format used in its preceding titles . The series ' traditional character assists have been removed ; instead , the game incorporates a tag-based combo system , which allows players to form continuous combos between their two characters . It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the Infinity Stones , which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected . The game is planned for release in September 2017 for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Microsoft Windows .   Infinite was announced during Sony 's PlayStation Experience event in December 2016 . Capcom initially lost the use of the Marvel license in 2012 , after The Walt Disney Company decided to focus on self-publishing its own gaming titles ; however , Capcom was able to reacquire the license after Disney scrapped their plans . Infinite was designed to be more accessible than previous Marvel vs. Capcom games , resulting in departures from some series ' mainstays , such as assists . The game will also feature a larger emphasis on storytelling , with its own cinematic story experience . The plot follows the heroes and villains of the Marvel and Capcom universes , who must work together to save their merged worlds against a new threat , Ultron Sigma . \nis a series of crossover fighting games developed and published by Capcom , featuring characters from their own video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics . The series originated as coin-operated arcade games , though later releases would be specifically developed for home consoles , handhelds , and personal computers .   Its gameplay borrows heavily from Capcom 's previous Marvel-licensed fighting games X-Men : Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes ; however , instead of focusing on single combat , the games incorporated tag team battles . Players form teams of two or three characters and , controlling one fighter at a time , attempt to damage and knock out their opponents . Players can switch out their characters during the match , allowing team members to replenish their health and prolong their ability to fight . The series ' gameplay is also distinguished from other fighting game franchises due to its character assist mechanics and emphasis on aerial combat .   The Marvel vs. Capcom series has received generally positive reviews from critics , who have praised its fast-paced gameplay , animated visuals , and wealth of playable characters . On the other hand , the games have been criticized for their lack of content , especially more recent installments . The series has enjoyed broad appeal , especially in markets outside of Japan , selling approximately 7 million units as of December 2016 .
