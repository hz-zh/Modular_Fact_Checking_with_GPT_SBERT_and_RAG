It was released as the lead single from the record on August 10 , 2013 . Perry co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its producers Dr. Luke , Max Martin , and Cirkut . It is a pop song containing elements of arena rock and lyrics centering on standing up for oneself and self-empowerment .   Some critics praised the track 's production while others felt that its lyrics contained `` clich\u00e9s '' . The song was a commercial success , becoming Perry 's eighth non-consecutive number one song on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 , and also topping charts in Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom . It also reached the top five in most international charts , including France , Germany , Italy , Japan , and Switzerland .   To promote the song , Perry performed under the Brooklyn Bridge at the closing ceremony of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , on The X Factor Australia , at the Sydney Opera House in late October 2013 , and on the German TV show Schlag den Raab . Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi directed the song 's music video , which features Perry trying to adapt to the jungle where she survived a plane crash , and taming a tiger . It garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics . `` Roar '' was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards . The song topped the charts in 14 countries and , by the end of 2013 , sold 9.9 million units -LRB- combined sales and track-equivalent streams -RRB- globally according to the IFPI . `` Roar '' has sold 6.4 million copies in the US , over 1 million in the UK .

The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , there are also cortical areas associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , a motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with a particular side of the brain , such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts known as commisures , the largest being the corpus callosum .   The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts known as peduncles . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system of the brain , which consists of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .   The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets . These connections form various neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry of the brain is driven by the process of neurotransmission .   The brain is protected by the skull , suspended in cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood -- brain barrier . However , the brain is still susceptible to damage , disease , and infection . Damage can be caused by trauma , or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke . The brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , forms of dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , and multiple sclerosis . A number of psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia and clinical depression , are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions , although the nature of these is not well understood . The brain can also be the site of tumours , both benign and malignant . Malignant tumours mostly originate from sites outside the brain .   The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy , while the study of its function is neuroscience . A number of different techniques are used to study the brain . Brain specimens from other animals , which may be examined microscopically , have been a traditional source of much information . Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography -LRB- EEG -RRB- recordings are important techniques in studying the brain . Examining the medical history of people with brain injury has also provided great insight into the function of each part of the brain .

Dalai Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school , the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism which is nominally headed by the Ganden Tripas . From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to 1959 , the central government of Tibet , the Ganden Phodrang , invested the position of Dalai Lama with temporal duties .   The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser village , Amdo , Tibet -LRB- was administratively in Qinghai province , Republic of China -RRB- , and was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama at a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939 . His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 , and he eventually assumed full temporal -LRB- political -RRB- duties on 17 November 1950 , at the age of 15 , after the People 's Republic of China 's invasion of Tibet . The Gelug school 's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the Tibet Autonomous Region just as the nascent PRC wished to assert central control over it .   During the 1959 Tibetan uprising , the Dalai Lama fled to India , where he currently lives as a refugee . The 14th Dalai Lama received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 . He has traveled the world and has spoken about the welfare of Tibetans , environment , economics , women 's rights , non-violence , interfaith dialogue , physics , astronomy , Buddhism and science , cognitive neuroscience , reproductive health , and sexuality , along with various Mahayana and Vajrayana topics .

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper .

Directed by Spike Lee , the film stars Derek Luke , Michael Ealy , Laz Alonso , Omar Benson Miller , Pierfrancesco Favino and Valentina Cervi . Set primarily in Italy during German-occupied Europe in World War II , the film tells the story of four Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division who seek refuge in a small Tuscan village , where they form a bond with the residents . The story is presented as a flashback , as one survivor reflects upon his experiences in a frame story set in 1980s New York . Several real-life events that occurred during the war , such as the Sant ` Anna di Stazzema massacre , are re-enacted , placing Miracle at St. Anna within the genre of historical fiction .   Lee first learned of the novel in 2004 and approached McBride with the idea of a film adaptation . In Europe , the film 's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini , who helped finance the $ 45 million production . A majority of the film was shot in Italy , on several locations affected by World War II . Other filming locations included New York , Louisiana and The Bahamas . Frequent Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard composed the score , and the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic .   Miracle at St. Anna premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival before it was released on September 26 , 2008 . It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies .

It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals -LRB- prosigns -RRB- as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character -LRB- letter or numeral -RRB- or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots -LRB- one dash -RRB- , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty .

She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels , The Vampire Chronicles , revolving around the central character of Lestat . Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations , Interview with the Vampire in 1994 , and Queen of the Damned in 2002 .   Born in New Orleans , Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas , and later to San Francisco . She was raised in an observant Catholic family , but became an agnostic as a young adult . She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to -LSB- her -RSB- life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .   In addition to her vampire novels , Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints -LRB- adapted for television in 2001 -RRB- and Servant of the Bones , which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries . Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers . Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure , including Exit to Eden , which was later adapted into a 1994 film .

Return a comma separated list of sentences.\n\nClaim: Speech recognition incorporates knowledge and research into multiple fields.\n\nSource Text: Linguistics is the scientific study of language , and involves an analysis of language form , language meaning , and language in context . The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE Indian grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini , who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his .   Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between sound and meaning . Phonetics is the study of speech and non-speech sounds , and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties . The study of language meaning , on the other hand , deals with how languages encode relations between entities , properties , and other aspects of the world to convey , process , and assign meaning , as well as manage and resolve ambiguity . While the study of semantics typically concerns itself with truth conditions , pragmatics deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning .   Grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language . These rules apply to sound as well as meaning , and include componential sub-sets of rules , such as those pertaining to phonology -LRB- the organisation of phonetic sound systems -RRB- , morphology -LRB- the formation and composition of words -RRB- , and syntax -LRB- the formation and composition of phrases and sentences -RRB- . Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within Noam Chomsky 's ideological school of generative linguistics .   In the early 20th century , Ferdinand de Saussure distinguished between the notions of langue and parole in his formulation of structural linguistics . According to him , parole is the specific utterance of speech , whereas langue refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language . This distinction resembles the one made by Noam Chomsky between competence and performance in his theory of transformative or generative grammar . According to Chomsky , competence is an individual 's innate capacity and potential for language -LRB- like in Saussure 's langue -RRB- , while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals , groups , and communities -LRB- i.e. , parole , in Saussurean terms -RRB- .   The study of parole -LRB- which manifests through cultural discourses and dialects -RRB- is the domain of sociolinguistics , the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain speech community -LRB- governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws -RRB- . Discourse analysis further examines the structure of texts and conversations emerging out of a speech community 's usage of language . This is done through the collection of linguistic data , or through the formal discipline of corpus linguistics , which takes naturally occurring texts and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora -LRB- or corpus data -RRB- .   Stylistics also involves the study of written , signed , or spoken discourse through varying speech communities , genres , and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media . In the 1960s , Jacques Derrida , for instance , further distinguished between speech and writing , by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself . Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts -LRB- as signs and symbols -RRB- in language . The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics , which explores the representation and function of language in the mind ; neurolinguistics , which studies language processing in the brain ; biolinguistics , which studies the biology and evolution of language ; and language acquisition , which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages .   Linguistics also deals with the social , cultural , historical and political factors that influence language , through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined . Research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focus on how languages change and grow , particularly over an extended period of time .   Language documentation combines anthropological inquiry -LRB- into the history and culture of language -RRB- with linguistic inquiry , in order to describe languages and their grammars . Lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary . Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary . Computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective . Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation , as well as in language education -- the teaching of a second or foreign language . Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research .   Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of semiotics -LRB- the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols -RRB- , literary criticism -LRB- the historical and ideological analysis of literature , cinema , art , or published material -RRB- , translation -LRB- the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another -RRB- , and speech-language pathology -LRB- a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the cognitive level -RRB- .

The word nun is typically used for female monastics .   Although the term monachos is of Christian origin , in the English language `` monk '' tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds .

In 2003 , James Wan and Leigh Whannell created a short film to help pitch as a potential feature film . This was successfully done in 2004 with the release of the first installment at the Sundance Film Festival . It was released theatrically that October . The sequels were directed by Darren Lynn Bousman , David Hackl , and Kevin Greutert , and were written by Wan , Whannell , Bousman , Patrick Melton , and Marcus Dunstan , and were released subsequently every October , on the Friday before Halloween , between 2004 and 2010 . Both of the creators remained with the franchise as executive producers . On July 22 , 2010 , producer Mark Burg confirmed that the seventh film , Saw 3D , is the final installment of the series . Series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell are still open to continuing the series , however , if they can do something `` different '' with the material . The films collectively grossed over $ 873 million at the box office worldwide . Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise in 2012 with a reboot . However , in November 2013 , it was reported that they were in active development of a sequel .   The franchise revolves around John Kramer , also called the `` Jigsaw Killer '' or simply `` Jigsaw '' . He was introduced briefly in Saw and developed in more detail in Saw II . Rather than killing his victims outright , Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls `` tests '' or `` games '' to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture . Despite the fact that John was murdered in Saw III , the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via flashbacks .   The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics , but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest grossing horror film franchies of all time . While the films are often compared to the American horror film Hostel -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and classified as torture porn by critics , the creators of Saw disagree with the term `` torture porn '' . Writer Luke Y. Thompson of OC Weekly argued that , unlike Hostel , the Saw films actually have less torture than most in the sense of sadism or masochism , as Jigsaw believes that those who survive his methods will be stronger people for it . He called him a kind of a '' -LRB- deranged -RRB- philanthropist '' . "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The films collectively grossed over $ 873 million at the box office worldwide ."}]}

The Islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark . Its area is about 1,400 km2 with a population of 50,030 in April 2017 .   The land of the Faeroes is rugged , and these islands have a subpolar oceanic climate -LRB- Cfc -RRB- : windy , wet , cloudy , and cool . Despite this island group 's northerly latitude , temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream .

Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of the Earth 's past . The age of Earth is approximately one-third of the age of the universe . An immense amount of geological change has occurred in that timespan , accompanied by the emergence of life and its subsequent evolution .   Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula . Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean ; but the atmosphere contained almost no oxygen and so would have been toxic to most modern life including humans . Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism . A giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia while Earth was in its earliest stage , also known as Early Earth , is thought to have been responsible for forming the Moon . Over time , the Earth cooled , causing the formation of a solid crust , and allowing liquid water to exist on the surface .   The geological time scale -LRB- GTS -RRB- clock -LRB- see graphic -RRB- depicts the larger spans of time from the beginning of the Earth as well as a chronology of some definitive events of Earth history . The Hadean Eon represents time before the reliable -LRB- fossil -RRB- record of life beginning on Earth ; it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 billion years ago as defined by international convention . The Archean and Proterozoic eons follow ; they produced the abiogenesis of life on Earth and then the evolution of early life . The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic , which is represented by its three component eras : the Palaeozoic ; the Mesozoic , which spanned the rise , reign , and climactic extinction of the huge dinosaurs ; and the Cenozoic , which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on Earth .   Hominins , the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade , rose sometime during the latter part of the Miocene epoch ; the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 mya . The succeeding Quaternary period is the time of recognizable humans , i.e. , the genus Homo , but that period 's two million-year-plus term of the recent times is too small to be visible at the scale of the GTS graphic . -LRB- Notes re the graphic : Ga means `` billion years '' ; Ma , `` million years '' . -RRB-   The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland as well as `` remains of biotic life '' found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , `` If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . ''   Living forms derived from photosynthesis appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today ; and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described .   Geological change has been a constant of Earth 's crust since the time of its formation , and biological change since the first appearance of life . Species continue to evolve , taking on new forms , splitting into daughter species or going extinct in the process of adapting or dying in response to ever-changing physical environments . The process of plate tectonics continues to play a dominant role in the shaping of Earth 's oceans and continents and the living species they harbor . Changes in the biosphere -- now dominated by human activity -- continue , in turn , to produce significant effects on the atmosphere and other systems of the Earth 's surface , such as the integrity of the ozone layer , the proliferation of greenhouse gases , the conditions of productive soils and clean air and water , and others .

A member of the Democratic Party , he served in a number of other senior roles , including eighth Vice President -LRB- 1833 -- 37 -RRB- and tenth Secretary of State -LRB- 1829 -- 31 -RRB- , both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson 's policies . Shortly after taking office , the Panic of 1837 struck the nation , and his inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis , combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party , led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election . During his half-century of public service , he built , perfected , and defended a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level . In New York he reorganized the Democratic-Republican Party and established the Albany Regency to keep it in power . He then moved on Washington where he did more than anyone to construct the modern Democratic Party which dominated American politics down to the American Civil War .   A delegate to a political convention at age 18 , he quickly moved from local to state politics , gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer . Elected to the Senate by the New York State Legislature in 1821 , Van Buren supported William H. Crawford for president in the 1824 election , but by 1828 had come to support Jackson . Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election , and ran for Governor of New York in the hope of using his personal popularity to boost Jackson 's campaign . Jackson and Van Buren were elected , and after serving as governor for two months , Van Buren resigned to become Jackson 's Secretary of State . During Jackson 's eight years as president , Van Buren was a key advisor , and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party , particularly in New York . In 1831 , following his resignation as Secretary of State , which aided Jackson in resolving the Petticoat affair , Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as American minister to Britain . Van Buren 's nomination was rejected by the Senate , cutting short his service in London , but he was elected vice president in the 1832 election .   Van Buren faced little opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1835 Democratic National Convention , and he defeated several Whig opponents in the 1836 presidential election . He was the first president to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch ancestry , he is the only president who spoke English as a second language , and was the first not to have a university degree or a military commission . As president , Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837 ; hostile newspapers called him `` Martin Van Ruin '' . He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury , rather than in state banks , but Congress would not approve of this until 1840 . In foreign affairs , he denied the application of Texas for admission to the Union , unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the Missouri Compromise , and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation . Additionally , relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair . In the 1840 election , Van Buren was voted out of office , losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison .   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to James K. Polk , who went on to win the election . In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party . He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse Franklin Pierce -LRB- 1852 -RRB- , James Buchanan -LRB- 1856 -RRB- , and Stephen A. Douglas -LRB- 1860 -RRB- for the presidency . However , his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the American Civil War . Van Buren 's health began to fail in 1861 , and he died in July 1862 at age 79 .
