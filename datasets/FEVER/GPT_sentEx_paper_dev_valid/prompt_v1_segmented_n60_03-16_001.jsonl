Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year , much in the same vein that its rival , the World Wrestling Entertainment , regards WrestleMania . As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .   From 1983 to 1987 , Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions -LRB- JCP -RRB- , the dominant promotion of the NWA , and aired on Thanksgiving Day . In 1987 , the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own , Survivor Series , on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event . In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum . In 1983 , JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition , and spread it across its territory on closed-circuit television . It popularized broadcasting on closed-circuit television and was financially successful . From 1987 , Starrcade was broadcast on pay-per-view , the first NWA event to do so .   The rights to the event now belong to WWE -LRB- formerly the World Wrestling Federation -RRB- . In November 2008 , WWE 24/7 Classics aired a special as a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the event called The Essential Starrcade . This five-part series counts down the top 25 matches in Starrcade history . In January 2009 , WWE Home Video released Starrcade : The Essential Collection as a three disc DVD set . With the launch of the WWE Network in 2014 all Starrcade shows became available on demand to Network subscribers .

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation -LRB- particularly of the financial sector -RRB- , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge -LRB- referred to as the `` poll tax '' -RRB- was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher -LRB- of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire -RRB- which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist .

Valencia is Spain 's third largest metropolitan area , with a population ranging from 1.7 to 2.5 million . The Port of Valencia is the 5th busiest container port in Europe and the busiest container port on the Mediterranean Sea . The city is ranked at Gamma in the Globalization and World Cities Research Network .   Valencia was founded as a Roman colony by the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus in 138 BC , and called Valentia Edetanorum . In 714 Moroccan and Arab Moors occupied the city , introducing their language , religion and customs ; they implemented improved irrigation systems and the cultivation of new crops as well , being capital of the Taifa of Valencia . In 1238 the Christian king James I of Aragon reconquered the city and divided the land among the nobles who helped him conquer it , as witnessed in the Llibre del Repartiment . He also created a new law for the city , the Furs of Valencia , which were extended to the rest of the Kingdom of Valencia . In the 18th century Philip V of Spain abolished the privileges as punishment to the kingdom of Valencia for aligning with the Habsburg side in the War of the Spanish Succession .

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture 's design and oversaw the project 's execution from 1927-1941 with the help of his son , Lincoln Borglum . Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington -LRB- 1732 -- 1799 -RRB- , Thomas Jefferson -LRB- 1743 -- 1826 -RRB- , Theodore Roosevelt -LRB- 1858 -- 1919 -RRB- , and Abraham Lincoln -LRB- 1809 -- 1865 -RRB- . The memorial park covers 1278.45 acre and is 5725 ft above sea level .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on Mount Rushmore , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents .   After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project . Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist . Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and it has appeared in works of fiction , as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million visitors annually .

She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels , The Vampire Chronicles , revolving around the central character of Lestat . Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations , Interview with the Vampire in 1994 , and Queen of the Damned in 2002 .   Born in New Orleans , Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas , and later to San Francisco . She was raised in an observant Catholic family , but became an agnostic as a young adult . She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to -LSB- her -RSB- life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .   In addition to her vampire novels , Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints -LRB- adapted for television in 2001 -RRB- and Servant of the Bones , which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries . Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers . Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure , including Exit to Eden , which was later adapted into a 1994 film .

In December 1928 , Bhagat Singh and an associate , Shivaram Rajguru , fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer , John Saunders , in Lahore , British India , mistaking Saunders , who was still on probation , for the British police superintendent , James Scott , whom they had intended to assassinate . They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai , by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured , and , two weeks after which , died of a heart attack . Saunders was felled by a single shot from Rajguru , a marksman . He was then shot several times by Singh , the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds . Another associate of Singh , Chandra Shekhar Azad , shot dead an Indian police constable , Chanan Singh , who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled .   After escaping , Singh and his associates , using pseudonyms , publicly owned to avenging Lajpat Rai 's death , putting up prepared posters , which , however , they had altered to show Saunders as their intended target . Singh was thereafter on the run for many months , and no convictions resulted at the time . Surfacing again in April 1929 , he and another associate , Batukeshwar Dutt , exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi . They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below , shouted slogans , and then allowed the authorities to arrest them . The arrest , and the resulting publicity , had the effect of bringing to light Singh 's complicity in the John Saunders case . Awaiting trial , Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike , demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners , and ending in Das 's death from starvation in September 1929 . Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931 , aged 23 .   Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death . Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him , `` Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate , for the moment , the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai , and through him of the nation . He became a symbol ; the act was forgotten , the symbol remained , and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab , and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India , resounded with his name . '' In still later years , Singh , an atheist and socialist in life , won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both Communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists . Although many of Singh 's associates , as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries , were also involved in daring acts , and were either executed or died violent deaths , few came to be lionized in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh .

Gaga began planning the project in 2011 , shortly after the launch of her second studio album , Born This Way . Work continued until 2013 while Gaga was traveling for her Born This Way Ball concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring .   Gaga described Artpop as `` a celebration and a poetic musical journey '' and an exploration of the `` reverse Warholian '' phenomenon in pop culture . It displays an intentional `` lack of maturity and responsibility '' by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way . Gaga collaborated with longtime partners Paul `` DJ White Shadow '' Blair and RedOne and new partners Zedd and Madeon . The lyrical themes revolve around her personal views of fame , love , sex , feminism , self-empowerment , overcoming addiction , and reactions to media scrutiny ; references include Greek and Roman mythology , and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra . Artpop also features guest vocals from T.I. , Too Short , Twista , and R. Kelly .   The release of Artpop was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed an `` ArtRave '' . The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics , but was commercially successful , debuting at number one on the United States Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 258,000 copies , becoming Gaga 's second consecutive number-one record in the United States and selling 757,000 copies . It also topped national record charts in five additional countries , and charted within the top ten in over twenty . Artpop was the ninth best seller album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide . It was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications .   `` Applause '' was released as the lead single from Artpop on August 12 , 2013 , and was a critical and commercial success , charting within the top ten of more than twenty countries worldwide , peaking at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 . The second single `` Do What U Want '' was released on October 21 , and peaked at number 13 in the United States . It was followed by promotional singles `` Venus '' and `` Dope '' shortly before the album 's release . `` G.U.Y. '' was the third and last single released from the album .

It is about creating something new by thinking across boundaries . It is related to an interdiscipline or an interdisciplinary field , which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought , as new needs and professions emerge .   The term interdisciplinary is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study . Interdisciplinarity involves researchers , students , and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought , professions , or technologies -- along with their specific perspectives -- in the pursuit of a common task . The epidemiology of AIDS or global warming requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems . Interdisciplinary may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions , for example , women 's studies or ethnic area studies . Interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields .   The adjective interdisciplinary is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand , including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines . For example , the subject of land use may appear differently when examined by different disciplines , for instance , biology , chemistry , economics , geography , and politics .

Over the 70s and 80s , Singh held several key posts in the Government of India , such as Chief Economic Advisor -LRB- 1972 -- 76 -RRB- , Reserve Bank governor -LRB- 1982 -- 85 -RRB- and Planning Commission head -LRB- 1985 -- 87 -RRB- .   In 1991 , as India faced a severe economic crisis , newly elected Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao surprisingly inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as Finance Minister . Over the next few years , despite strong opposition , he as a Finance Minister carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India 's economy . Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis , and enhanced Singh 's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist , the incumbent Congress party fared poorly in the 1996 general election . Subsequently , Singh served as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha -LRB- the upper house of India 's Parliament -RRB- during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1998 -- 2004 .   In 2004 , when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance -LRB- UPA -RRB- came to power , its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh . Singh 's first ministry executed several key legislations and projects , including the Rural Health Mission , Unique Identification Authority , Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act . In 2008 , opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh 's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support . Although India 's economy grew rapidly under UPA I , its security was threatened by several terrorist incidents -LRB- including the 2008 Mumbai attacks -RRB- and the continuing Maoist insurgency .   The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate , with Singh retaining the office of Prime Minister . Over the next few years , Singh 's second ministry government faced a number of corruption charges -- over the organisation of the Commonwealth Games , the 2G-spectrum allocation and the allocation of coal blocks . After his term ended in 2014 he opted out from the race to the office of the Prime Minister of India during 2014 Indian general election . Singh was never a member of the Lok Sabha but continues to serve as a member of the Indian Parliament , representing the state of Assam in the Rajya Sabha for the fifth consecutive term since 1991 .

Portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston , the character was created by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman , and appeared in each of the show 's 236 episodes during its decade-long run , from its premiere on September 22 , 1994 to its finale on May 6 , 2004 . Introduced in the show 's pilot as a naive runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City , Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled , inexperienced daddy 's girl into a successful businesswoman . During the show 's second season , the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross , with whom she maintains a complicated on-again , off-again relationship throughout the entire series . Together , the characters have a daughter , Emma .   The role of Rachel was originally offered to actresses T\u00e9a Leoni , the producer 's first choice , and Courteney Cox , both of whom declined , Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth , and Cox in favor of playing Rachel 's best friend Monica in Friends . A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms , Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live . After acquiring the role and before Friends aired , Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom , Muddling Through , at the time , which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends .   Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout Friends decade-long run , with The A.V. Club attributing much of the show 's early success to the character . However , some of her storylines have been criticized , specifically her romantic relationship with her friend Joey during season ten . Rachel 's popularity established her as the show 's breakout character , who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all-time , while the character 's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own . Named the `` Rachel '' after her , the character 's shag continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history , in spite of Aniston 's own resentment towards it . Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s . Meanwhile , the character 's relationship with Ross is often cited among television 's most beloved .   Rachel is considered to be Aniston 's breakout role , credited with making her the show 's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career . Praised for her performance as Rachel , Aniston won both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series -- Comedy Or Musical .
