These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland -LRB- 1889 -- 1936 -RRB- in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government -LRB- 2004 -- 2012 -RRB- and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 .

Manson 's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August of 1969 .

Manson was originally sentenced to death ; however , his death sentence was converted to life with the possibility of parole when in 1972 , the death penalty in California was ruled unconstitutional . California did not have the life-without-parole sentence at the time . Manson also received first-degree murder convictions for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald `` Shorty '' Shea . He is currently serving a life sentence at California State Prison , Corcoran , in Corcoran , California .   Manson believed in what he called `` Helter Skelter '' , a term he took from the Beatles ' song of the same name . Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war , which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles ' song . He believed the murders would help precipitate that war . From the beginning of his notoriety , a pop culture arose around him in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity , violence and the macabre .   At the time the Family began to form , Manson was an unemployed former convict , who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses . Before the murders , he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry , chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson , drummer and founding member of the Beach Boys . After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted , recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially .

His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven -LRB- c. 347 BC -RRB- . His writings cover many subjects -- including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy . Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC .   Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies . He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books . The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism , but , following Plato 's death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism . He believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception . Aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .   Aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl -LRB- reproductive -RRB- arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century . His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .   In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church . Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' -LRB- -LSB- -RRB- .   His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today . Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .

Discovered by actress Norma Shearer , Leigh made her acting debut on radio in 1946 and secured a contract with MGM the following year . Early in her career , she appeared in popular films spanning a wide variety of genres , including Act of Violence -LRB- 1948 -RRB- , Little Women -LRB- 1949 -RRB- , Angels in the Outfield -LRB- 1951 -RRB- , Scaramouche -LRB- 1952 -RRB- , The Naked Spur -LRB- 1953 -RRB- and Living It Up -LRB- 1954 -RRB- .

The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England -LRB- the largest of the three realms -RRB- from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie -LRB- 1597 -RRB- , The True Law of Free Monarchies -LRB- 1598 -RRB- , and Basilikon Doron -LRB- 1599 -RRB- . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch .

Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis -LRB- of which he had been one of the architects -RRB- , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa .

In 2005 , Packouz -LRB- 23 years old at the time -RRB- joined Efraim Diveroli -LRB- 19 years old at the time -RRB- in Diveroli 's arms company AEY Inc. . By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million . In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions . The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition . Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller . Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .

The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC .   After the demise of the Second Triumvirate , Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies . In reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator . By law , Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate , including supreme military command , and those of tribune and censor . It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule . He rejected monarchical titles , and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis -LRB- `` First Citizen of the State '' -RRB- . The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate , the first phase of the Roman Empire .   The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana -LRB- The Roman Peace -RRB- . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the `` Year of the Four Emperors '' over the imperial succession . Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire , annexing Egypt , Dalmatia , Pannonia , Noricum , and Raetia ; expanding possessions in Africa ; expanding into Germania ; and completing the conquest of Hispania .   Beyond the frontiers , he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy . He reformed the Roman system of taxation , developed networks of roads with an official courier system , established a standing army , established the Praetorian Guard , created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome , and rebuilt much of the city during his reign .   Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75 . He probably died from natural causes , although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him . He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son -LRB- also stepson and former son-in-law -RRB- Tiberius .

He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons . After winning championships in high school and college , Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers . He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season , and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s . Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV , but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game , winning the All-Star MVP Award . After protests from his fellow players , he retired again for four years , but returned in 1996 , at age 36 , to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time .   Johnson 's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards , nine NBA Finals appearances , twelve All-Star games , and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations . He led the league in regular-season assists four times , and is the NBA 's all-time leader in average assists per game , at 11.2 .

With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal -LRB- with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God -RRB- and nu metal -LRB- with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park -RRB- , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

The club is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section -LRB- 1893 -RRB- , has traditionally worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played its home matches in several grounds , being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Juventus is also the most successful club in Italian football , the one that has the most sporting tradition in the country and one of the most awarded globally having won overall sixty-three official titles on the national and international stage , more than any other club in Italy : a record thirty-three official league titles , a record twelve Coppa Italia titles , a record seven Supercoppa Italiana titles and , with eleven titles in confederation and inter-confederation competitions -LRB- two Intercontinental Cups , two European Champion Clubs ' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup -RRB- it ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won .

The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the -LRB- now-defunct -RRB- Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup -LRB- the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament -RRB- .

In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide .

It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon -LRB- Yr Wyddfa -RRB- , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff -LRB- the capital -RRB- , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added -LRB- GVA -RRB- was # 45.5 billion -LRB- # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain -RRB- .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .

Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year , much in the same vein that its rival , the World Wrestling Entertainment , regards WrestleMania . As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .   From 1983 to 1987 , Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions -LRB- JCP -RRB- , the dominant promotion of the NWA , and aired on Thanksgiving Day . In 1987 , the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own , Survivor Series , on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event . In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum .

The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915 , the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up , arrested , and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara , the majority of whom were eventually murdered .  The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly , and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide , and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide .   Raphael Lemkin was explicitly moved by the Armenian annihilation , to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943 . The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides , because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out in order to eliminate the Armenians , and it is the second most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust .   Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , denies the word genocide as an accurate term for the mass killings of Armenians that began under Ottoman rule in 1915 . It has in recent years been faced with repeated calls to recognize them as genocide . To date , 29 countries and 46 US states have officially recognized the mass killings as genocide , as have most genocide scholars and historians .

Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union , achieving statehood on February 14 , 1912 .

Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation \u2212 where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases -LRB- CVD -RRB- are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment .

The phenomenon revealed differences in human colour perception which have been the subject of ongoing scientific investigation in neuroscience and vision science , with a number of papers published in peer-reviewed science journals .   The photo originated from a washed-out colour photograph of a dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr , and a dispute over whether the dress pictured was blue and black , or white and gold . In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone , more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress , using hashtags such as #thedress , #whiteandgold and #blackandblue . Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be black and blue , the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms , with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour . At the same time , members of the scientific community began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision .   The dress itself , which was identified as a product of the retailer Roman Originals , experienced a major surge in sales as a result of the incident . The retailer also produced a one-off version of the dress actually coloured in white and gold as a charity campaign .
