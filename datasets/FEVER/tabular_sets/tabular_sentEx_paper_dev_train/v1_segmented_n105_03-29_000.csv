Hispanics have lived within what is now the United States continuously since the founding of St. Augustine by the Spanish in 1565 . After Native Americans , Hispanics are the oldest ethnic group to inhabit much of what is today the United States . Many have Native American ancestry . Spain colonized large areas of what is today the American Southwest and West Coast , as well as Florida . Its holdings included present-day California , New Mexico , Nevada , Arizona , and Texas , all of which were part of the Republic of Mexico from its independence in 1821 until the end of the Mexican -- American War in 1848 .

Mogadishu ( [ ˌmɔːɡəˈdiːʃuː ] Muqdisho [ mʉqdɪʃɔ ] ; مقديشو [ maqadiːʃuː ] ) , known locally as Hamar , is the capital and most populous city of Somalia . Located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean , the city has served as an important port for millennia . , it has a population of 2,425,000 residents .   Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers . These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland ( 1889 -- 1936 ) in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government ( 2004 -- 2012 ) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 . Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction .   As Somalia 's capital city , many important national institutions are based in Mogadishu . It is the seat of the Federal Government of Somalia established in August 2012 , with the Somalia Federal Parliament serving as the government 's legislative branch . Thabit Abdi Mohammed has been the Mayor of Mogadishu since April 2017 . Villa Somalia is the official residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia , Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed . In May 2012 , the First Somali Bank was established in the capital , which organized Mogadishu 's first ever Technology , Entertainment , Design ( TEDx ) conference . The establishment of a local construction yard has also galvanized the city 's real-estate sector . Arba'a Rukun Mosque is one of the oldest Islamic places of worship in the capital , built circa 667 ( 1268/9 AD ) . The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity in Mogadishu is the largest masjid in the Horn region . Mogadishu Cathedral was built in 1928 by the colonial authorities in Italian Somaliland in a Norman Gothic style , and served as the traditional seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio . The National Museum of Somalia is based in Mogadishu and holds many culturally important artefacts . The National Library of Somalia is undergoing a $ 1 million Somali federal government funded renovation , including a new library complex .   Mogadishu is home to a number of scholastic and media institutions . As part of the municipality 's urban renewal program , 100 schools across the capital are scheduled to be refurbished and reopened . The Somali National University ( SNU ) was established in the 1950s , and professors from the university later founded the non-governmental Mogadishu University ( MU ) . Benadir University ( BU ) was established in 2002 with the intention of training doctors . Various national sporting bodies have their headquarters in Mogadishu , including the Somali Football Federation and the Somali Olympic Committee . Mogadishu Stadium was constructed in 1978 during the Siad Barre administration , with the assistance of Chinese engineers . It hosts football matches with teams from the Somali First Division and the Somalia Cup . Additionally , the Port of Mogadishu serves as a major national seaport and is the largest harbour in Somalia . Mogadishu International Airport , the capital 's main airport , is the hub of the national carrier Somali Airlines . ",SUPPORTS

Charles Manson has been proven innocent of all crimes.,"After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted , recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially .","
Charles Milles Manson ( born Charles Milles Maddox , November 12 , 1934 ) is an American criminal and former cult leader who led what became known as the Manson Family , a quasi-commune that arose in California in the late 1960s . Manson 's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August of 1969 . In 1971 he was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people ( Abigail Ann Folger , Wojciech Frykowski , Steven Earl Parent , Sharon Tate Polanski , Jay Sebring , and Leno and Rosemary La Bianca ) -- most notably of the actress Sharon Tate -- all of which were carried out by members of the group at his instruction . Manson was originally sentenced to death ; however , his death sentence was converted to life with the possibility of parole when in 1972 , the death penalty in California was ruled unconstitutional . California did not have the life-without-parole sentence at the time . Manson also received first-degree murder convictions for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald `` Shorty '' Shea . He is currently serving a life sentence at California State Prison , Corcoran , in Corcoran , California .   Manson believed in what he called `` Helter Skelter '' , a term he took from the Beatles ' song of the same name . Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war , which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles ' song . He believed the murders would help precipitate that war . From the beginning of his notoriety , a pop culture arose around him in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity , violence and the macabre .   At the time the Family began to form , Manson was an unemployed former convict , who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses .

Aristotle spent time in Athens.,"At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( c. 347 BC ) .","
Aristotle ( [ ˈærɪˌstɒtəl ] Ἀριστοτέλης , [ aristotélɛːs ] , Aristotélēs ; 384 -- 322 BC ) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira , Chalkidice , on the northern periphery of Classical Greece . His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( c. 347 BC ) . His writings cover many subjects -- including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy . Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC .   Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies . He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books . The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism , but , following Plato 's death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism . He believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception . Aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .   Aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century . His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .   In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church . Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' ( [ ) .   His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today . Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .

James VI and I ( 19 June 1566 -- 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since .

Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , ( 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 ) was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis ( of which he had been one of the architects ) , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community .   Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth .   Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage .

[ Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus , ] means `` Commander Caesar , Son of the God [ Julius Caesar ] , the Venerable '' . 23 September 63 BC -- 19 August 14 AD ) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Roman emperor , controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14 . The dates of his rule are contemporary dates ; Augustus lived under two calendars , the Roman Republican until 45 BC , and the Julian after 45 BC . Due to departures from Julius Caesar 's intentions , Augustus finished restoring the Julian calendar in March AD 4 , and the correspondence between the proleptic Julian calendar and the calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8 BC . ( Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003 : 670 -- 1 )   He was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia . His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC , and Octavius was named in Caesar 's will as his adopted son and heir , then known as Octavianus ( Anglicized as Octavian ) . He , Mark Antony , and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar . Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi , the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators.As part of the Triumvirate , Octavian ruled the Western provinces , Antony ruled the Eastern provinces , and Lepidus ruled Africa . The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC .   After the demise of the Second Triumvirate , Augustus restored the outward façade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies . In reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator . By law , Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate , including supreme military command , and those of tribune and censor . It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule . He rejected monarchical titles , and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ( `` First Citizen of the State '' ) . The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate , the first phase of the Roman Empire .   The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana ( The Roman Peace ) . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the `` Year of the Four Emperors '' over the imperial succession . Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire , annexing Egypt , Dalmatia , Pannonia , Noricum , and Raetia ; expanding possessions in Africa ; expanding into Germania ; and completing the conquest of Hispania .   Beyond the frontiers , he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy . He reformed the Roman system of taxation , developed networks of roads with an official courier system , established a standing army , established the Praetorian Guard , created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome , and rebuilt much of the city during his reign .   Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75 . He probably died from natural causes , although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him . He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son ( also stepson and former son-in-law ) Tiberius . ",REFUTES

Heavy Metal music was developed in the early 1970's.,"Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States .","
Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal ( with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God ) and nu metal ( with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park ) , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

Wales ( [ ˈweɪlz ] Cymru [ ˈkəm.rɨ ] ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was # 45.5 billion ( # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness . ",SUPPORTS

As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .

In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum . In 1983 , JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition , and spread it across its territory on closed-circuit television . It popularized broadcasting on closed-circuit television and was financially successful . From 1987 , Starrcade was broadcast on pay-per-view , the first NWA event to do so .

The Armenian Genocide was the killing of Armenians who were mostly Ottoman natives.,"The Armenian Genocide ( Հայոց ցեղասպանություն , Hayots tseghaspanutyun ) , also known as the Armenian Holocaust , was the Ottoman government 's systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians , mostly Ottoman citizens within the Ottoman Empire and its successor state , the Republic of Turkey .","
The Armenian Genocide ( Հայոց ցեղասպանություն , Hayots tseghaspanutyun ) , also known as the Armenian Holocaust , was the Ottoman government 's systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians , mostly Ottoman citizens within the Ottoman Empire and its successor state , the Republic of Turkey . The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915 , the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up , arrested , and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara , the majority of whom were eventually murdered .  The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly , and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide , and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide .   Raphael Lemkin was explicitly moved by the Armenian annihilation , to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943 . The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides , because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out in order to eliminate the Armenians , and it is the second most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust .   Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , denies the word genocide as an accurate term for the mass killings of Armenians that began under Ottoman rule in 1915 . It has in recent years been faced with repeated calls to recognize them as genocide . To date , 29 countries and 46 US states have officially recognized the mass killings as genocide , as have most genocide scholars and historians . ",SUPPORTS

Workit and Mestayit regents to their minor sons have been held responsible for their provinces.","There have been several studies concerning women in Ethiopia. Historically, elite and powerful women in Ethiopia have been visible as administrators and warriors. This never translated into any benefit to improve the rights of women, but it had meant that women could inherit and own property and act as advisors on important communal and tribal matters. As late as the first part of the 20th century, Queen Menen, consort of Emperor Haile Selassie I, had a decisive role in running the Ethiopian Empire. Workit and Mestayit regents to their minor sons have been held responsible for their provinces. They owed their rights to landed property because of a special type of land tenure that expected tenants to serve as militia to overlords, irrespective of gender. In 1896, Empress Tayetu Betul, wife of Emperor Menelik II, actively advised the government and participated in defending the country from Italian invasion. Prominent and other landowning women fought against the second invasion in 1935–41. With the assistance of European advisors, women in the ensuing period were kept out of the army and politics, even as advisors.
