1477,Rabies is only spread through saliva.,"[['Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human .', 'Rabies', 9, []]]","
Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months ; however , this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system .   Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . More than 99 % of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5 % of cases are from dogs . Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies . The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves . The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms .   Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world . Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk . The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common . In people who have been exposed to rabies , the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms . Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water , povidone iodine , or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission . Only five people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms , and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol .   Rabies caused about 17,400 deaths worldwide in 2015 . More than 95 % of human deaths caused by rabies occur in Africa and Asia . About 40 % of deaths occur in children under the age of 15 . Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica . More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs . A number of countries , including Australia and Japan , as well as much of Western Europe , do not have rabies among dogs . Many small island nations do not have rabies at all . It is classified as a neglected tropical disease . ",0,0.79,3,25,117,67,325

A monster is any creature , usually found in legends or horror fiction , that is often hideous and may produce fear or physical harm by its appearance or its actions . The word `` monster '' derives from Latin monstrum , meaning an aberrant occurrence , usually biological , that was taken as a sign that something was wrong within the natural order .   The word usually connotes something wrong or evil ; a monster is generally morally objectionable , physically or psychologically hideous , or a freak of nature . It can also be applied figuratively to a person with similar characteristics like a greedy person or a person who does horrible things .   The root of monstrum is monere -- which does not only mean to warn but also to instruct , and forms the basis of the modern English demonstrate . Thus , the monster is also a sign or instruction . This benign interpretation was proposed by Saint Augustine , who did not see the monster as inherently evil , but as part of the natural design of the world , a kind-of deliberate category error .   Well known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula , Frankenstein 's monster , werewolves , mummies , and zombies , to name a few . ",0,0.49,3,8,52,86,386

Keith Rupert Murdoch [ ˈmɜrdɒk ] , AC , KCSG ( born 11 March 1931 ) is an Australian-born American media mogul . His father , Sir Keith Murdoch , had been a reporter , editor , and senior executive of the Herald and Weekly Times newspaper publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales . After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited . Murdoch thus had full control as Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation , now the world 's second-largest media conglomerate , and its successors , News Corp and 21st Century Fox , after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013 .   In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen ( and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship ) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens . Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International .

Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , ( 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 ) was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis ( of which he had been one of the architects ) , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community .   Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth .   Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage .

Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica , although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty .   The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .   Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing .

The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals , which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system . Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation − where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment . ",0,1.3,5,89,310,110,780

Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .

The Colosseum or Coliseum ( [ kɒləˈsiːəm ] ) , also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre ( Latin : Amphitheatrum Flavium ; Italian : Anfiteatro Flavio [ aŋfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo ] or Colosseo [ kolosˈsɛːo ] ) , is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome , Italy . Built of concrete and sand , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian ( 81 -- 96 ) . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name ( Flavius ) .   The Colosseum could hold , it is estimated , between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators , having an average audience of some 65,000 ; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles ( for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities ) , animal hunts , executions , re-enactments of famous battles , and dramas based on Classical mythology . The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era . It was later reused for such purposes as housing , workshops , quarters for a religious order , a fortress , a quarry , and a Christian shrine .   Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers , the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome . It is one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church , as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit `` Way of the Cross '' procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum .   The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin .   The Colosseum 's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium , often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre . The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty , following the reign of Nero . This name is still used in modern English , but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum . In antiquity , Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum ( with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar ) , but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum ; Vespasian and Titus , builders of the Colosseum , also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) .   The name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby ( the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes ) . This statue was later remodeled by Nero 's successors into the likeness of Helios ( Sol ) or Apollo , the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . Nero 's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors . Despite its pagan links , the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers . It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome .   In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colisæus , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colisæus , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus ( `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' ) . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus ( as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ) . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre .   The Colossus did eventually fall , possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze . By the year 1000 the name `` Colosseum '' had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre . The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives , situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma .   The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages . In Italy , the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo , and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul ( Romanian ) , le Colisée ( French ) , el Coliseo ( Spanish ) and o Coliseu ( Portuguese ) .

Michigan [ ˈmɪʃᵻgən ] is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States . The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa , meaning `` large water '' or `` large lake '' . Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry . 
A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America . There are 50 states , which are bound together in a union with each other . Each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory , and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government . Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government , Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons covered by certain types of court orders ( e.g. , paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) .   States range in population from just under 600,000 ( Wyoming ) to over 39 million ( California ) , and in area from 1214 sqmi ( Rhode Island ) to 663268 sqmi ( Alaska ) . Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names .   States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches : executive , legislative , and judicial .   States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution ; among them ratifying constitutional amendments . Historically , the tasks of local law enforcement , public education , public health , regulating intrastate commerce , and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities , although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well . Over time , the U.S. Constitution has been amended , and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed . The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation , with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did . There is a continuing debate over states ' rights , which concerns the extent and nature of the states ' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals .   States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is represented in the Senate by two senators , and is guaranteed at least one Representative in the House . Representatives are elected from single-member districts ; seats in the House are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College , the body that elects the President of the United States , equal to the total of representatives and senators from that state .   The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union . Since the establishment of the United States in 1776 , the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 . Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted , both in 1959 .   The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede ( withdraw ) from the Union . Shortly after the Civil War , the U.S. Supreme Court , in Texas v. White , held that a state can not unilaterally do so . ",0,0.42,3,19,101,150,2457

Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish psychological thriller film written and directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers , Scarlett Johansson , Emily Mortimer , Matthew Goode , Brian Cox , and Penelope Wilton . In the film , Rhys Meyers 's character marries into a wealthy family , but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law 's girlfriend , played by Johansson . The film treats themes of morality , greed , and the roles of lust , money , and luck in life , leading many to compare it to Allen 's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors ( 1989 ) . It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York . The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom . Allen quickly re-wrote the script , which was originally set in New York , for a British setting .   Critics in the United States praised the film and its British setting , and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen . In contrast , reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favourably , finding fault with the locations and especially the idiom of the dialogue .

Henry Louis `` Buster '' Gehrig ( born Heinrich Ludwig Gehrig ; June 19 , 1903June 2 , 1941 ) was an American baseball first baseman who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the New York Yankees , from 1923 through 1939 . Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability , a trait that earned him his nickname `` The Iron Horse '' . He was an All-Star seven consecutive times , a Triple Crown winner once , an American League ( AL ) Most Valuable Player twice , and a member of six World Series champion teams . He had a career .340 batting average , .632 slugging average , and a .447 on base average . He hit 493 home runs and had 1,995 runs batted in ( RBI ) . In 1939 , he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number ( 4 ) retired by a team .   A native of New York City and attendee of Columbia University , Gehrig signed with the Yankees in 1923 . He set several major league records during his career , including the most career grand slams ( 23 ) ( since broken by Alex Rodriguez ) and most consecutive games played ( 2,130 ) , a record that stood for 56 years and was long considered unbreakable until surpassed by Cal Ripken , Jr. in 1995 . Gehrig 's streak ended on May 2 , 1939 , when he voluntarily took himself out of the lineup to stunned fans after his play was hampered by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , an incurable neuromuscular disorder now commonly referred to in North America as Lou Gehrig 's disease . The disease forced him to retire at age 36 and was the cause of his death two years later . The pathos of his farewell from baseball was capped off by his iconic 1939 `` Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth '' speech at Yankee Stadium .   Gehrig was voted the greatest first baseman of all time by the Baseball Writers ' Association in 1969 , and was the leading vote-getter on the Major League Baseball All-Century Team chosen by fans in 1999 . A monument in Gehrig 's honor , originally dedicated by the Yankees in 1941 , currently resides in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium .

It has the longest documented history of any living language , spanning 34 centuries of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic and many other writing systems .   The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koiné Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , the Greek language is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , Turkey , and the Greek diaspora .

Saturday Night Live ( abbreviated as SNL ) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol . The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! '' , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 , Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 829 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-second season on May 20 , 2017 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 50 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests . 
Michaela Suzanne Watkins ( born December 14 , 1971 ) is an American actress and comedian .

Carlos Santana ( born July 20 , 1947 ) is a Mexican and American musician who first became famous in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his band , Santana , which pioneered a fusion of rock and Latin American music . The band 's sound featured his melodic , blues-based guitar lines set against Latin and African rhythms featuring percussion instruments such as timbales and congas not generally heard in rock music . Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades . He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s . In 2003 Rolling Stone magazine listed Santana at number 20 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time . He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards . 
Santana is an American Latin rock band formed in San Francisco , California in 1966 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana . The band first came to widespread public attention when their performance of `` Soul Sacrifice '' at Woodstock in 1969 provided a contrast to other acts on the bill . This exposure helped propel their first album , also named Santana , into a hit , followed in the next two years by the successful Abraxas and Santana III .   In the years that followed , lineup changes were common . Carlos Santana 's increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music , though never quite losing its initial Latin influence .   In 1998 , Santana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , with Carlos Santana , Jose `` Chepito '' Areas , David Brown , Gregg Rolie , Mike Carabello and Michael Shrieve being honored .   The band has earned nine Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards , the latter all in 2000 . Carlos also won a Grammy Award as a solo artist in 1988 .

Tijuana ( [ tiːˈwɑːnə ] ; [ tiˈxwana ] ) is the largest city in Baja California and on the Baja California Peninsula and center of the Tijuana metropolitan area , part of the international San Diego -- Tijuana metropolitan area . As an industrial and financial center of Mexico , Tijuana exerts a strong influence on economics , education , culture , art , and politics . As the city has become a leading center in the country , so has the surrounding metropolitan area , a major industrial and paramount metropolis in northwestern Mexico . Currently one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Mexico , Tijuana maintains global city status . , the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,696,923 .   Tijuana is located on the Gold Coast of Baja California , and is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality . Tijuana covers 70 % of the municipality but contains over 80 % of its population . A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent , the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies . In the early 21st century , Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America . Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca . The city is the most visited border city in the globe ; sharing a border of about 24 km with its sister city San Diego . More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year . This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the busiest land-border crossing in the world . It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone .   Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico . According to the 2010 census , the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico , with a population of 1,784,034 , but rankings vary , the city ( locality ) itself was 6th largest and the municipality ( administrative ) 3rd largest nationally . The international metropolitan region was estimated to be just over five million in 2009 and about 5,105,769 in 2010 , making it the third largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region , 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas , and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico . Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego ; during the 2000s the drug violence had residents moving out of the congested urban core into isolated communities within the municipality and beyond , as evidenced by 2010 Census figures and growth patterns .   Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias . As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , Tijuana 's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure . The city was founded in July 11 , 1889 as urban development began . Often known by its initials , T.J. , and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico , the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s . ",0,2.1700000000000004,5,16,78,52,437

Human trafficking is the trade in people , especially women and children , and does not necessarily involve the movement of the person from one place to another .

The Colosseum or Coliseum ( [ kɒləˈsiːəm ] ) , also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre ( Latin : Amphitheatrum Flavium ; Italian : Anfiteatro Flavio [ aŋfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo ] or Colosseo [ kolosˈsɛːo ] ) , is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome , Italy . Built of concrete and sand , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian ( 81 -- 96 ) . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name ( Flavius ) .   The Colosseum could hold , it is estimated , between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators , having an average audience of some 65,000 ; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles ( for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities ) , animal hunts , executions , re-enactments of famous battles , and dramas based on Classical mythology . The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era . It was later reused for such purposes as housing , workshops , quarters for a religious order , a fortress , a quarry , and a Christian shrine .   Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers , the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome . It is one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church , as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit `` Way of the Cross '' procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum .   The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin .   The Colosseum 's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium , often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre . The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty , following the reign of Nero . This name is still used in modern English , but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum . In antiquity , Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum ( with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar ) , but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum ; Vespasian and Titus , builders of the Colosseum , also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) .   The name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby ( the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes ) . This statue was later remodeled by Nero 's successors into the likeness of Helios ( Sol ) or Apollo , the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . Nero 's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors . Despite its pagan links , the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers . It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome .   In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colisæus , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colisæus , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus ( `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' ) . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus ( as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ) . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre .   The Colossus did eventually fall , possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze . By the year 1000 the name `` Colosseum '' had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre . The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives , situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma .   The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages . In Italy , the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo , and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul ( Romanian ) , le Colisée ( French ) , el Coliseo ( Spanish ) and o Coliseu ( Portuguese ) .

Located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean , the city has served as an important port for millennia . , it has a population of 2,425,000 residents .   Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers . These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland ( 1889 -- 1936 ) in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government ( 2004 -- 2012 ) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies .

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher ( of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire ) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 .

His government is the fourth longest one in the history of Italy as a republic . Renzi served as President of the Province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and as Mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014 .   At the age of 39 years and 42 days upon assuming office , Renzi is the youngest person to serve as Italian Prime Minister ( 52 days younger than Benito Mussolini , who took office in 1922 ) and was the youngest leader in the G7 . He was also the first serving Mayor to become Prime Minister . Renzi was sometimes described as the de facto leader of the Party of European Socialists , in opposition to the European People 's Party associated with Angela Merkel ; the two leaders are together often referred to as Merkenzi . In 2014 the American magazine Fortune ranked Renzi as the third most influential person under 40 in the world ; and Foreign Policy listed him as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers . Moreover , Renzi is nicknamed il Rottamatore ( the Scrapper ) due to his ambition of renovating the Italian political establishment .   While in power Renzi 's Government implemented numerous reforms , including changes to the electoral system , a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth , a thorough reformation of the public administration , the simplification of civil trials , the introduction of same-sex civil unions , and the abolition of many small taxes . 
A constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016 . Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy , as well as the division of powers between the State , the regions , and administrative entities .   The bill , put forward by then - Prime Minister of Italy , Matteo Renzi , and his centre-left Democratic Party , was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014 . After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 ( Senate ) and 11 January 2016 ( Chamber ) , and , eventually , its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 ( Senate ) and 12 April 2016 ( Chamber ) .   In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution , a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote . 59.11 % of voters voted against the constitutional reform , meaning it did not come into effect . This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic ; the other two were in 2001 ( in which the amending law was approved ) and in 2006 ( in which it was rejected ) .   Had the voters approved the constitutional law , it would have achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy since the end of the monarchy , not only influencing the organization of the Parliament , but also improving , according to its proponents , on the poor government stability of the country . Opposition parties harshly criticised the bill , claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful .   Following the clear victory of the `` No '' vote , Renzi tendered his resignation as Prime Minister . Paolo Gentiloni was selected as his replacement on December 11 .

It has the longest documented history of any living language , spanning 34 centuries of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic and many other writing systems .   The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koiné Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , the Greek language is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , Turkey , and the Greek diaspora .

Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry .

Basildon [ ˈbæzɪldən ] is the largest town in the borough of Basildon in the county of Essex , England .   It lies 32 mi east of Central London , 11 mi south of the city of Chelmsford and 10 mi west of Southend-on-Sea . Nearby smaller towns include Billericay to the north , Wickford northeast and South Benfleet to the east . It was created as a new town after World War II in 1948 to accommodate the London population overspill , from the conglomeration of four small villages , namely Pitsea , Laindon , Basildon and Vange . The new town which took the name Basildon was the most central of the four .   The local government district of Basildon , which was formed in 1974 and received borough status in 2010 , encapsulates a larger area than the town itself ; the two neighbouring towns of Billericay and Wickford , as well as rural villages and smaller settlements set among the surrounding countryside , fall within its borders . Basildon Town is one of the most densely populated areas in the county .   Some of Basildon 's residents work in Central London due to the town being well connected in the county to the City of London and the Docklands financial and corporate headquarters districts , with a 36 -- 58 minute journey from the three Basildon stations to London Fenchurch Street . Basildon also has access to the City via road , on the A127 , and A13 . 
Central London is the innermost part of London , UK . There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment , high land values , an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally , nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities . Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics , urban planning and local government .   Road distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross ( in the City of Westminster ) , which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand , Whitehall and Cockspur Street , just south of Trafalgar Square . 
The new towns in the United Kingdom were planned under the powers of the New Towns Act 1946 and later acts to relocate populations in poor or bombed-out housing following the Second World War . They were developed in three waves . Later developments included the expanded towns : existing towns which were substantially expanded to accommodate what was called the `` overspill '' population from densely populated areas of deprivation .   Designated new towns were removed from local authority control and placed under the supervision of a development corporation . These corporations were later disbanded and their assets split between local authorities and , in England , the Commission for New Towns ( later English Partnerships ) . 
London overspill is the term given to the communities created as a result of the government policy of moving residents out of Greater London into other areas in the South East of England between the 1930s and the 1970s . These largely consisted of council houses and new towns . 
The City of London is a city and county that is an enclave of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) .   The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase `` the city of London '' by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sqmi in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created .   The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries . The Corporation is headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London , an office separate from ( and much older than ) the Mayor of London . The current Lord Mayor , as of November 2016 , is Andrew Parmley .   The City is a major business and financial centre . Throughout the 19th century , the City was the world 's primary business centre , and it continues to be a major meeting point for businesses . London came top in the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index , published in 2008 . The insurance industry is focused around the eastern side of the City , around Lloyd 's building . A secondary financial district exists outside of the City , at Canary Wharf , 2.5 mi to the east .   The City has a resident population of about 7,000 ( 2011 ) but over 300,000 people commute to and work there , mainly in the financial services sector . The legal profession forms a major component of the northern and western sides of the City , especially in the Temple and Chancery Lane areas where the Inns of Court are located , of which two -- Inner Temple and Middle Temple -- fall within the City of London boundary . 
Billericay ( [ bɪləˈrɪkiː ] ) is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Basildon , Essex , England . It lies within the London Basin and constitutes a commuter town 28 mi east of central London . The town has three secondary schools and a variety of open spaces . It is thought to have been occupied since the Bronze Age . ",0,0.35,3,1,10,689,4668

Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes , such as signaling and self-sustaining processes , from those that do not , either because such functions have ceased , or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate . Various forms of life exist , such as plants , animals , fungi , protists , archaea , and bacteria . The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses , viroids , or potential artificial life as `` living '' . Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life , although many other sciences are involved .   The definition of life is controversial . The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis , are composed of cells , undergo metabolism , can grow , adapt to their environment , respond to stimuli , and reproduce . However , many other biological definitions have been proposed , and there are some borderline cases of life , such as viruses . Throughout history , there have been many attempts to define what is meant by `` life '' and many theories on the properties and emergence of living things , such as materialism , the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it ; hylomorphism , the belief that all things are a combination of matter and form , and the form of a living thing is its soul ; spontaneous generation , the belief that life repeatedly emerges from non-life ; and vitalism , a now largely discredited hypothesis that living organisms possess a `` life force '' or `` vital spark '' . Modern definitions are more complex , with input from a diversity of scientific disciplines . Biophysicists have proposed many definitions based on chemical systems ; there are also some living systems theories , such as the Gaia hypothesis , the idea that the Earth itself is alive . Another theory is that life is the property of ecological systems , and yet another is elaborated in complex systems biology , a branch or subfield of mathematical biology . Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter , such as simple organic compounds . Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions .   Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago , soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago , and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago . Earth 's current life may have descended from an RNA world , although RNA-based life may not have been the first . The mechanism by which life began on Earth is unknown , though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the Miller -- Urey experiment . The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes believed to be present in the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) of all living organisms .   Since its primordial beginnings , life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale . To survive in most ecosystems , life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions . Some microorganisms , called extremophiles , thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth . Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms . Later , Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species . Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered , such as cells and microorganisms , forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms . Cells are sometimes considered the smallest units and `` building blocks '' of life . There are two kinds of cells , prokaryotic and eukaryotic , both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . Cells reproduce through a process of cell division , in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells .   Though currently only known on Earth , life need not be restricted to it , and many scientists believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life . Artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life , which is often used to examine systems related to natural life . Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism , and as such , is the end of its life . Extinction is the process by which an entire group or taxon , normally a species , dies out . Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms . ",0,0.8600000000000001,4,25,108,125,664

Martin Van Buren ( Maarten van Buren ; December 5 , 1782 -- July 24 , 1862 ) was an American politician who served as the eighth President of the United States ( 1837 -- 41 ) . A member of the Democratic Party , he served in a number of other senior roles , including eighth Vice President ( 1833 -- 37 ) and tenth Secretary of State ( 1829 -- 31 ) , both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson 's policies . Shortly after taking office , the Panic of 1837 struck the nation , and his inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis , combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party , led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election . During his half-century of public service , he built , perfected , and defended a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level . In New York he reorganized the Democratic-Republican Party and established the Albany Regency to keep it in power . He then moved on Washington where he did more than anyone to construct the modern Democratic Party which dominated American politics down to the American Civil War .   A delegate to a political convention at age 18 , he quickly moved from local to state politics , gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer . Elected to the Senate by the New York State Legislature in 1821 , Van Buren supported William H. Crawford for president in the 1824 election , but by 1828 had come to support Jackson . Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election , and ran for Governor of New York in the hope of using his personal popularity to boost Jackson 's campaign . Jackson and Van Buren were elected , and after serving as governor for two months , Van Buren resigned to become Jackson 's Secretary of State . During Jackson 's eight years as president , Van Buren was a key advisor , and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party , particularly in New York . In 1831 , following his resignation as Secretary of State , which aided Jackson in resolving the Petticoat affair , Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as American minister to Britain . Van Buren 's nomination was rejected by the Senate , cutting short his service in London , but he was elected vice president in the 1832 election .   Van Buren faced little opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1835 Democratic National Convention , and he defeated several Whig opponents in the 1836 presidential election . He was the first president to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch ancestry , he is the only president who spoke English as a second language , and was the first not to have a university degree or a military commission . As president , Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837 ; hostile newspapers called him `` Martin Van Ruin '' . He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury , rather than in state banks , but Congress would not approve of this until 1840 . In foreign affairs , he denied the application of Texas for admission to the Union , unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the Missouri Compromise , and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation . Additionally , relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair . In the 1840 election , Van Buren was voted out of office , losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison .   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to James K. Polk , who went on to win the election . In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party . He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse Franklin Pierce ( 1852 ) , James Buchanan ( 1856 ) , and Stephen A. Douglas ( 1860 ) for the presidency . However , his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the American Civil War . Van Buren 's health began to fail in 1861 , and he died in July 1862 at age 79 . ",0,0.79,4,11,89,858,8405

Creedence Clearwater Revival , often informally abbreviated to Creedence or CCR , was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s . The band consisted of lead vocalist , lead guitarist , and primary songwriter John Fogerty , his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty , bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford . Their musical style encompassed the roots rock , swamp rock , and blues rock genres . Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins , they played in a Southern rock style , with lyrics about bayous , catfish , the Mississippi River , and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography , as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War . The band performed at 1969 's famed Woodstock Festival .   After four years of chart-topping success , the group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 . Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year , and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control , all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits between the former bandmates . Fogerty 's ongoing disagreements with Saul Zaentz , owner of their label Fantasy Records , created further protracted court battles . As a result , John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving former members at CCR 's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   Creedence Clearwater Revival 's music is still a staple of U.S. radio airplay ; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone .

Croatia ( [ kroʊˈeɪʃə ] ; Hrvatska [ xř̩ʋaːtskaː ] ) , officially the Republic of Croatia ( [ Republika Hrvatska , links = no ] , ) , is a sovereign state between Central Europe , Southeast Europe , and the Mediterranean . Its capital city is Zagreb , which forms one of the country 's primary subdivisions , along with its twenty counties . Croatia covers 56594 km2 and has diverse , mostly continental and Mediterranean climates . Croatia 's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands . The country 's population is 4.28 million , most of whom are Croats , with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism .   The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD . They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century . Tomislav became the first king by 925 , elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom . The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries , reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Petar Krešimir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir . Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102 . In 1527 , faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne . During the early 19th century , parts of the country were split into the French Illyrian Provinces , and Austria-Hungary occupied its Bosnia and Herzegovina side -- a dispute settled by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin . In 1918 , after World War I , Croatia was included in the unrecognized State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs which seceded from Austria-Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . A fascist Croatian puppet state backed by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany existed during World War II . After the war , Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , a constitutionally socialist state . On 25 June 1991 Croatia declared independence , which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year . The Croatian War of Independence was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration .   A unitary state , Croatia is a republic governed under a parliamentary system . The International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy , and the World Bank identified it as a high-income economy . Croatia is a member of the European Union ( EU ) , United Nations ( UN ) , the Council of Europe , NATO , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean . As an active participant in the UN peacekeeping forces , Croatia has contributed troops to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2008 -- 2009 term .   The service sector dominates Croatia 's economy , followed by the industrial sector and agriculture . International Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer , with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world . The state controls a part of the economy , with substantial government expenditure . The European Union is Croatia 's most important trading partner . Since 2000 , the Croatian government constantly invests in infrastructure , especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors . Internal sources produce a significant portion of energy in Croatia ; the rest is imported . Croatia provides a universal health care system and free primary and secondary education , while supporting culture through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in media and publishing . 
A sovereign state is , in international law , a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralized government that has sovereignty over a geographic area . International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population , defined territory , one government , and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states . It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state .   The existence or disappearance of a state is a question of fact . While according to the declarative theory of statehood , a sovereign state can exist without being recognised by other sovereign states , unrecognised states will often find it hard to exercise full treaty-making powers and engage in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states .

Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes , such as signaling and self-sustaining processes , from those that do not , either because such functions have ceased , or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate . Various forms of life exist , such as plants , animals , fungi , protists , archaea , and bacteria . The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses , viroids , or potential artificial life as `` living '' . Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life , although many other sciences are involved .   The definition of life is controversial . The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis , are composed of cells , undergo metabolism , can grow , adapt to their environment , respond to stimuli , and reproduce . However , many other biological definitions have been proposed , and there are some borderline cases of life , such as viruses . Throughout history , there have been many attempts to define what is meant by `` life '' and many theories on the properties and emergence of living things , such as materialism , the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it ; hylomorphism , the belief that all things are a combination of matter and form , and the form of a living thing is its soul ; spontaneous generation , the belief that life repeatedly emerges from non-life ; and vitalism , a now largely discredited hypothesis that living organisms possess a `` life force '' or `` vital spark '' . Modern definitions are more complex , with input from a diversity of scientific disciplines . Biophysicists have proposed many definitions based on chemical systems ; there are also some living systems theories , such as the Gaia hypothesis , the idea that the Earth itself is alive . Another theory is that life is the property of ecological systems , and yet another is elaborated in complex systems biology , a branch or subfield of mathematical biology . Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter , such as simple organic compounds . Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions .   Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago , soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago , and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago . Earth 's current life may have descended from an RNA world , although RNA-based life may not have been the first . The mechanism by which life began on Earth is unknown , though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the Miller -- Urey experiment . The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes believed to be present in the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) of all living organisms .   Since its primordial beginnings , life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale . To survive in most ecosystems , life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions . Some microorganisms , called extremophiles , thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth . Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms . Later , Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species . Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered , such as cells and microorganisms , forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms . Cells are sometimes considered the smallest units and `` building blocks '' of life . There are two kinds of cells , prokaryotic and eukaryotic , both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . Cells reproduce through a process of cell division , in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells .   Though currently only known on Earth , life need not be restricted to it , and many scientists believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life . Artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life , which is often used to examine systems related to natural life . Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism , and as such , is the end of its life . Extinction is the process by which an entire group or taxon , normally a species , dies out . Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms . ",0,0.49,5,41,110,125,664

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970 . Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury ( lead vocals , piano ) , Brian May ( lead guitar , vocals ) , Roger Taylor ( drums , vocals ) , and John Deacon ( bass guitar ) . Queen 's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock , hard rock and heavy metal , but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles , such as arena rock and pop rock , into their music .   Before forming Queen , Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile . Freddie Mercury ( then known by his birth name of Farrokh `` Freddie '' Bulsara ) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques . Mercury joined the band in 1970 , suggested `` Queen '' as a new band name , and adopted his familiar stage name . John Deacon was recruited before the band recorded their eponymous debut album in 1973 . Queen first charted in the UK with their second album , Queen II , in 1974 , but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success . The latter featured `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' , which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video .   The band 's 1977 album News of the World contained `` We Will Rock You '' and `` We Are the Champions '' , which have become anthems at sporting events . By the early 1980s , Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world . Released in 1980 , `` Another One Bites the Dust '' is their best selling single , while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US . Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications , and the best in a 2005 industry poll . In 1991 , Mercury died of bronchopneumonia , a complication of AIDS , and Deacon retired in 1997 . Since then , May and Taylor have performed under the name of Queen with Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert as vocalists on several tours .   The band have released a total of 18 number-one albums , 18 number-one singles , and 10 number-one DVDs . Estimates of their record sales generally range from 150 million to 300 million records , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists .

Guam ( [ ˈɡwɑːm ] or [ ˈɡwɒm ] Chamorro : Guåhån [ ˈɡʷɑhɑn ] formally the Territory of Guam ) is an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States . Located in the western Pacific Ocean , Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government . The capital city is Hagåtña and the most populous city is Dededo . In 2015 , 161,785 people resided on Guam . Guamanians are American citizens by birth . Guam has an area of 210 sq mi ( 544 km ² ) and a population density of 770/sq mi ( 297/km ² ) . It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands and the largest island in Micronesia . Among its municipalities , Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 3,691 / sq mi ( 1,425 / km ² ) , whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 119/sq mi ( 47/km ² ) . The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 m above sea level .   The Chamorros , Guam 's indigenous people , settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago . Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6 , 1521 . Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers , like Diego Luis de San Vitores , a Catholic missionary . Between the 16th century and the 18th century , Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons . During the Spanish -- American War , the United States captured Guam on June 21 , 1898 . Under the Treaty of Paris , Spain ceded Guam to the United States on December 10 , 1898 . Guam is among the seventeen Non-Self-Governing Territories of the United Nations .   Before World War II , Guam and four other territories -- American Samoa , Hawaii , Wake Island , and the Philippines -- were the only American jurisdictions in the Pacific Ocean . On December 7 , 1941 , hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor , Guam was captured by the Japanese , who occupied the island for thirty months . During the occupation , Guamanians were subjected to beheadings , forced labor , rape , and torture . Guam endured hostilities when American forces recaptured the island on July 21 , 1944 ; Liberation Day commemorates the victory . Since the 1960s , the economy has been supported by two industries : tourism and the United States Armed Forces . ",0,0.42,3,5,34,255,1762

Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones , lights , or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment . It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals ( prosigns ) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character ( letter or numeral ) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots ( one dash ) , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty . ",0,0.56,4,15,97,124,526

The Balkan Wars ( Balkan Savaşları , literally `` the Balkan Wars '' or Balkan Faciası , meaning `` the Balkan Tragedy '' ) consisted of two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe in 1912 and 1913 . Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war ; one of the four , Bulgaria , suffered defeat in the second war . The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe . Austria-Hungary , although not a combatant , became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples . The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a `` prelude to the First World War '' .   By the early 20th century , Bulgaria , Greece , Montenegro and Serbia had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire , but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule . In 1912 these countries formed the Balkan League . The First Balkan War had three main causes :   The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself , govern satisfactorily , or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples .  The Great Powers quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms . This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution .  Most importantly , the Balkan League had been formed , and its members were confident that it could defeat the Turks .   The Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River Maritsa as a result of the two Balkan Wars , which thus delineated present-day Turkey 's western border . A large influx of Turks started to flee into the Ottoman heartland from the lost lands . By 1914 , the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans .   Citizens of Turkey regard the Balkan Wars as a major disaster ( Balkan harbi faciası ) in the nation 's history . The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a psycho-traumatic event amongst many Turks that is said to have triggered the ultimate collapse of the empire itself within five years . Nazım Pasha , Chief of Staff of the Ottoman Army , was held responsible for the failure and was assassinated on 23 January 1913 during the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état carried out by the `` Young Turks '' .   The First Balkan War began when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire on 8 October 1912 and ended eight months later with the signing of the Treaty of London on 30 May 1913 . The Second Balkan War was begun on 16 June 1913 . Both Serbia and Greece , utilizing the argument that the war had been prolonged , repudiated important particulars of the pre-war treaty and retained occupation of all the conquered districts in their possession , which were to be divided according to specific predefined boundaries . Seeing the treaty as trampled , Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in Macedonia ( made in secret by its former allies , Serbia and Greece ) and commenced military action against them . The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into Bulgaria from the west and the south . Romania , who having taken no part in the conflict , had intact armies to strike with , invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states . The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining Adrianople . In the resulting Treaty of Bucharest , Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of Dobroudja province to Romania . 
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFR Yugoslavia or SFRY ) was the Yugoslav state in southeastern Europe that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1992 amid the Yugoslav Wars . Covering an area of 255,804 km ² ( 98,766 sq mi ) , the SFRY was bordered by Italy to the west , Austria and Hungary to the north , Bulgaria and Romania to the east and Albania and Greece to the south .   It was a socialist state and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia made up of six socialist republics : Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Slovenia with Belgrade as its capital . In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina .   The SFRY traces back to 26 November 1942 when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposal of King Peter II thus ending the monarchy . The new communist government originally sided with the Eastern bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but the SFRY pursued a policy of neutrality after the Tito -- Stalin split of 1948 , and it became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement .   Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , rising ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s led to dissidence among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics . With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe , inter-republic talks on transformation of the federation also failed and led to recognition of their independence by some European states in 1991 . This led to the federation collapsing along federal borders , followed by the start of the Yugoslav Wars and the final downfall and breakup of the federation on 27 April 1992 . Two of its republics , Serbia and Montenegro , remained within the reconstituted Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , but the union was not recognized internationally as the official successor state to the SFRY . The term `` former Yugoslavia '' ( bivša Jugoslavija or бивша Југославија ) is now commonly used retrospectively . 
Macedonia ( Република Македонија , tr . Republika Makedonija ) , is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe . It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia , from which it declared independence in 1991 . It became a member of the United Nations in 1993 , but , as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name `` Macedonia '' , was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( sometimes abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia ) , a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union , the Council of Europe and NATO .   A landlocked country , the Republic of Macedonia has borders with Kosovo to the northwest , Serbia to the north , Bulgaria to the east , Greece to the south , and Albania to the west . It constitutes approximately the northwestern third of the larger geographical region of Macedonia , which also comprises the neighbouring parts of northern Greece and smaller portions of southwestern Bulgaria and southeastern Albania . The country 's geography is defined primarily by mountains , valleys , and rivers . The capital and largest city , Skopje , is home to roughly a quarter of the nation 's 2.06 million inhabitants . The majority of the residents are ethnic Macedonians , a South Slavic people . Albanians form a significant minority at around 25 percent , followed by Turks , Romani , Serbs , and others .   Macedonia 's history dates back to antiquity , beginning with the kingdom of Paeonia , a Thracian polity . In the late sixth century BCE the area was incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire , then annexed by the Kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BCE . The Romans conquered the region in the second century BCE and made it part of the much larger province of Macedonia . Macedonia remained part of the Byzantine ( Eastern Roman ) Empire , and was often raided and settled by Slavic peoples beginning in the sixth century CE . Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian and Byzantine empires , it gradually came under Ottoman dominion from the 14th century . Between the late 19th and early 20th century , a distinct Macedonian identity emerged , although following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 , the modern territory of Macedonia came under Serbian rule . In the aftermath of the First World War ( 1914 -- 1918 ) it became incorporated into the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia , which after the Second World War was re-established as a republic ( 1945 ) and which became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963 . Macedonia remained a constituent socialist republic within Yugoslavia until its peaceful secession in 1991 .   Macedonia is a member of the UN and of the Council of Europe . Since 2005 it has also been a candidate for joining the European Union and has applied for NATO membership . Although one of the poorest countries in Europe , Macedonia has made significant progress in developing an open , market based economy . 
Macedonia [ mæsᵻˈdoʊniə ] is a geographical and historical region of the Balkan peninsula in southeastern Europe . Its boundaries have changed considerably over time , however it came to be defined as the modern geographical region by the mid 19th century . Nowadays the region is considered to include parts of six Balkan countries : Greece , the Republic of Macedonia , Bulgaria , Albania , Serbia and Kosovo . It covers approximately 67000 km2 and has a population of 4.76 million .   Its oldest known settlements date back approximately 9,000 years . From the middle of the 4th century BC , the Kingdom of Macedon became the dominant power on the Balkan peninsula ; since then Macedonia has had a diverse history . 
Albania ( [ ælˈbeɪniə , _ ɔːl - ] , ; Shqipëri / Shqipëria Shqipni/Shqipnia or Shqypni/Shqypnia ) , officially the Republic of Albania ( Republika e Shqipërisë , [ ɾɛpuˈblika ɛ ʃcipəˈɾiːsə ] ) , is a country in Southeastern Europe . Albania spans 28,748 km2 and had a total population of almost 3 million people .   It is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic with the capital in Tirana , the country 's largest city and main economic and commercial centre , followed by Durrës and Vlorë . It is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula , bordered by Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo to the northeast , the Republic of Macedonia to the east , and Greece to the south and southeast . The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea , the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins . Albania is less than 72 km from Italy , across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea .   During the classical times , the modern area of Albania was home to several Illyrian , Thracian and Greek tribes , as well as several Greek colonies established on the Illyrian coast . In the 3rd century BC , the area was annexed by Rome and became part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia , Macedonia and Moesia Superior . In 1190 , the first Albanian entity , the Principality of Arbanon was established by archon Progon in the region of Krujë , within the Byzantine Empire . The territory of Albania was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century , of which it remained part of for the next five centuries . After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in Europe , following the Balkan Wars , Albania declared its independence in 1912 and was recognized the following year . The Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy in 1939 , which formed Greater Albania , before becoming a Nazi German protectorate in 1943 . The following year , a socialist People 's Republic was established under the leadership of Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour . Albania experienced widespread social and political transformations in the communist era , as well as isolation from much of the international community . In 1991 , the Socialist Republic was dissolved and the Republic of Albania was established .   Albania is a democratic and developing country with an upper-middle income economy . The service sector dominates the country 's economy , followed by the industrial and agriculture sector . After the fall of communism in Albania , free-market reforms have opened the country to foreign investment , especially in the development of energy and transportation infrastructure . Albania has a high HDI and provides universal health care system and free primary and secondary education to its citizens .   Albania is a member of the United Nations , NATO , WTO , World Bank , the Council of Europe , the OSCE , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation . It is also an official candidate for membership in the European Union . Albania is one of the founding members of the Energy Community , Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Union for the Mediterranean . It is home to the largest lake in Southern Europe and one of the oldest lakes in Europe . ",0,0.6300000000000001,4,17,50,645,4680

The Faroe Islands , also called the Faeroes , is an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic , about halfway between Norway and Iceland , 200 mi north-northwest of Scotland . The Islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark . Its area is about 1,400 km2 with a population of 50,030 in April 2017 .   The land of the Faeroes is rugged , and these islands have a subpolar oceanic climate ( Cfc ) : windy , wet , cloudy , and cool . Despite this island group 's northerly latitude , temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream .   Between 1035 and 1814 , the Faeroes were part of the Hereditary Kingdom of Norway . In 1814 , the Treaty of Kiel granted Denmark control over the islands , along with two other Norwegian island possessions : Greenland and Iceland . The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948 . The Faroese have control of most domestic matters .

Henry II ( Henri II 31 March 1519 -- 10 July 1559 ) was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 31 March 1547 until his death in 1559 . The second son of Francis I , he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis III , Duke of Brittany , in 1536 .   As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father . Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion . He persevered in the Italian Wars against the House of Habsburg and tried to suppress the Protestant Reformation , even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign .   The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis ( 1559 ) , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics . France failed to change the balance of power in Europe , as Spain remained the sole dominant power , but it did benefit from the division of the holdings of its ruler , Charles V , and from the weakening of the Holy Roman Empire , which Charles also ruled .   Henry suffered an untimely death in a jousting tournament held to celebrate the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis at the conclusion of the Eighth Italian War . The king 's surgeon , Ambroise Paré , was unable to cure the infected wound inflicted by Gabriel de Montgomery , the captain of his Scottish Guard . He was succeeded in turn by three of his sons , whose ineffective reigns helped to spark the French Wars of Religion between Protestants and Catholics . ",0,1.07,4,24,107,96,447

Located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean , the city has served as an important port for millennia . , it has a population of 2,425,000 residents .   Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers . These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland ( 1889 -- 1936 ) in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government ( 2004 -- 2012 ) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 . Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction .   As Somalia 's capital city , many important national institutions are based in Mogadishu .

Thabit Abdi Mohammed has been the Mayor of Mogadishu since April 2017 . Villa Somalia is the official residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia , Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed . In May 2012 , the First Somali Bank was established in the capital , which organized Mogadishu 's first ever Technology , Entertainment , Design ( TEDx ) conference . The establishment of a local construction yard has also galvanized the city 's real-estate sector .

The Hundred Years ' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet , rulers of the Kingdom of England , against the House of Valois , rulers of the Kingdom of France , over the succession of the French throne . Each side drew many allies into the war . It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages , in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe . The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline , and the development of strong national identities in both countries .   After the Norman Conquest , the kings of England were vassals of the kings of France for their possessions in France . The French kings had endeavored , over the centuries , to reduce these possessions , to the effect that only Gascony was left to the English . The confiscation or threat of confiscating this duchy had been part of French policy to check the growth of English power , particularly whenever the English were at war with the Kingdom of Scotland , an ally of France .   Through his mother , Isabella of France , Edward III of England was the grandson of Philip IV of France and nephew of Charles IV of France , the last king of the senior line of the House of Capet . In 1316 , a principle was established denying women succession to the French throne . When Charles IV died in 1328 , Isabella , unable to claim the French throne for herself , claimed it for her son . The French rejected the claim , maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess . For about nine years ( 1328 -- 1337 ) , the English had accepted the Valois succession to the French throne , but the interference of the French king , Philip VI , in Edward III 's war against Scotland permitted Edward III to reassert his claim to the French throne . Several overwhelming English victories in the war -- especially at Crecy , Poitiers , and Agincourt -- raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph . However , the greater resources of the French monarchy precluded a complete conquest . Starting in 1429 , decisive French victories at Orléans , Patay , Formigny , and Castillon concluded the war in favour of France , with England permanently losing most of its major possessions on the continent .   Historians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by truces : the Edwardian Era War ( 1337 -- 1360 ) ; the Caroline War ( 1369 -- 1389 ) ; and the Lancastrian War ( 1415 -- 1453 ) . Local conflicts in neighbouring areas , which were contemporarily related to the war , including the War of the Breton Succession ( 1341 -- 1364 ) , the Castilian Civil War ( 1366 -- 1369 ) , the War of the Two Peters ( 1356 -- 1375 ) in Aragon , and the 1383 -- 85 Crisis in Portugal , were availed by the parties to advance their agendas . Later historians adopted the term `` Hundred Years ' War '' as a historiography periodization to encompass all of these events , thus constructing the longest military conflict in European history .   The war owes its historical significance to multiple factors . By its end , feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops , and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies . Although primarily a dynastic conflict , the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism . The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the feudal armies where heavy cavalry had dominated , and artillery became important . The war precipitated the creation of the first standing armies in Western Europe since the time of the Western Roman Empire and thus helping to change their role in warfare . With respect to the belligerents , in France , civil wars , deadly epidemics , famines , and bandit free-companies of mercenaries reduced the population drastically . English political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture . The dissatisfaction of English nobles , resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings , became a factor leading to the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses ( 1455 -- 1487 ) .

By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million . In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions . The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition . Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller . Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .

During the show 's second season , the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross , with whom she maintains a complicated on-again , off-again relationship throughout the entire series . Together , the characters have a daughter , Emma .   The role of Rachel was originally offered to actresses Téa Leoni , the producer 's first choice , and Courteney Cox , both of whom declined , Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth , and Cox in favor of playing Rachel 's best friend Monica in Friends .

Francis I ( François Ier ) ( 12 September 1494 -- 31 March 1547 ) was the first King of France from the Angoulême branch of the House of Valois , reigning from 1515 until his death . He was the son of Charles , Count of Angoulême , and Louise of Savoy . He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII , who died without a male heir .   A prodigious patron of the arts , he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Château de Chambord , including Leonardo da Vinci , who brought the Mona Lisa with him , which Francis had acquired . Francis ' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France , the spread of humanism and Protestantism , and the beginning of French exploration of the New World . Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire .   For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language , he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres ( the `` Father and Restorer of Letters '' ) . He was also known as François au Grand Nez ( `` Francis of the Large Nose '' ) , the Grand Colas , and the Roi-Chevalier ( the `` Knight-King '' ) for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V.   Following the policy of his predecessors , Francis continued the Italian Wars . The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands , the throne of Spain , and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor , meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy . In his struggle against Imperial hegemony , he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold . When this was unsuccessful , he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent , a controversial move for a Christian king at the time . ",0,1.28,6,34,104,122,877

Charles Milles Manson ( born Charles Milles Maddox , November 12 , 1934 ) is an American criminal and former cult leader who led what became known as the Manson Family , a quasi-commune that arose in California in the late 1960s . Manson 's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August of 1969 . In 1971 he was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people ( Abigail Ann Folger , Wojciech Frykowski , Steven Earl Parent , Sharon Tate Polanski , Jay Sebring , and Leno and Rosemary La Bianca ) -- most notably of the actress Sharon Tate -- all of which were carried out by members of the group at his instruction . Manson was originally sentenced to death ; however , his death sentence was converted to life with the possibility of parole when in 1972 , the death penalty in California was ruled unconstitutional . California did not have the life-without-parole sentence at the time . Manson also received first-degree murder convictions for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald `` Shorty '' Shea . He is currently serving a life sentence at California State Prison , Corcoran , in Corcoran , California .   Manson believed in what he called `` Helter Skelter '' , a term he took from the Beatles ' song of the same name . Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war , which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles ' song . He believed the murders would help precipitate that war . From the beginning of his notoriety , a pop culture arose around him in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity , violence and the macabre .   At the time the Family began to form , Manson was an unemployed former convict , who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses . Before the murders , he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry , chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson , drummer and founding member of the Beach Boys . After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted , recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially .

Sid Meier 's Civilization IV is a turn-based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the Civilization series . It was designed by Soren Johnson under the direction of Sid Meier and his video game development studio Firaxis Games . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia , between October 25 and November 4 , 2005 .   Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay , in which the player 's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources . Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC . As with other games in the series , there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game : conquering all other civilizations , controlling a supermajority of the game world 's land and population , building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system , increasing the `` Culture ratings '' of at least three different cities to `` legendary '' levels , or winning a `` World Leader '' popularity contest by the United Nations . If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players , the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner . A large departure from earlier Civilization games is a new graphics engine created from scratch , based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited ( NDL ) .   The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre . Civilization IV has sold 3 million copies and won multiple awards , including several Game of the Year awards . In addition to this , Firaxis Games has also released two major expansions , Civilization IV : Warlords and Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword , as well as the standalone game Civilization IV : Colonization , which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled Sid Meier 's Civilization IV : The Complete Edition . 
A game engine is a software framework designed for the creation and development of video games . Developers use them to create games for consoles , mobile devices and personal computers . The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine ( `` renderer '' ) for 2D or 3D graphics , a physics engine or collision detection ( and collision response ) , sound , scripting , animation , artificial intelligence , networking , streaming , memory management , threading , localization support , scene graph , and may include video support for cinematics . The process of game development is often economized , in large part , by reusing/adapting the same game engine to create different games , or to make it easier to `` port '' games to multiple platforms . 
Firaxis Games , Inc. is an American video game developer founded in 1996 by Sid Meier , Jeff Briggs , and Brian Reynolds upon leaving MicroProse . Now a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive , the company is best known for its Civilization series of games , though it has had notable success with other titles as well .

Michigan [ ˈmɪʃᵻgən ] is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States . The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa , meaning `` large water '' or `` large lake '' . Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) .

As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father . Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion . He persevered in the Italian Wars against the House of Habsburg and tried to suppress the Protestant Reformation , even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign .   The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis ( 1559 ) , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics .

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . ",0,0.8600000000000001,4,21,77,96,736

A working animal is an animal , usually domesticated , that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks . They may be close members of the family , such as guide dogs or other assistance dogs , or they may be animals trained to provide tractive force , such as draft horses or logging elephants . The latter types of animals are called draft animals ( draught animals ) or beasts of burden . Most working animals are either service animals or draft animals . They may also be used for milking or herding , jobs that require human training to encourage the animal to cooperate . Some , at the end of their working lives , may also be used for meat or other products such as leather .   The history of working animals may predate agriculture , with dogs used by our hunter-gatherer ancestors . Around the world , millions of animals work in relationship with their owners . Domesticated species are often bred to be suitable for different uses and conditions , especially horses and working dogs . Working animals are usually raised on farms , though some are still captured from the wild , such as dolphins and some Asian elephants .   People have found uses for a wide variety of abilities found in animals and even in industrialized society many animals are still used for work . The strength of horses , elephants and oxen is used in pulling carts and logs . The keen sense of smell of dogs is used to search for drugs and explosives as well helping to find game while hunting and to search for missing or trapped people . Several animals including camels , donkeys , horses and dogs are used for transport , either riding or to pull wagons and sleds . Other animals including dogs and monkeys provide assistance to blind or disabled people .   On rare occasions , wild animals may be not only tamed , but trained to perform work , though often solely for novelty or entertainment purposes , as such animals tend to lack the traits of trustworthiness and mild temper that characterize the true domesticated working animal . Conversely , not all domesticated animals are working animals . For example , while cats may perform work catching mice , it is an instinctive behavior , not one that can be trained by human intervention . Other domesticated animals , such as sheep , or rabbits , may have agricultural uses for meat , hides and wool , but are not suitable for work . Finally , small domestic pets such as most birds ( other than certain types of pigeon ) or hamsters are generally incapable of performing work other than that of providing simple companionship .

Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge , Massachusetts , established in 1636 , whose history , influence , and wealth have made it one of the world 's most prestigious universities .   Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard ( its first benefactor ) , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning , and the Harvard Corporation ( formally , the President and Fellows of Harvard College ) is its first chartered corporation . Although never formally affiliated with any denomination , the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869 -- 1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war . The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College .   The university is organized into eleven separate academic units -- ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study -- with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area : its 209 acre main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 mi northwest of Boston ; the business school and athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area . Harvard 's $ 34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution .   Harvard is a large , highly residential research university . The nominal cost of attendance is high , but the university 's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages . It operates several arts , cultural , and scientific museums , alongside the Harvard Library , which is the world 's largest academic and private library system , comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes .  Harvard 's alumni include eight U.S. presidents , several foreign heads of state , 62 living billionaires , 359 Rhodes Scholars , and 242 Marshall Scholars .

James VI and I ( 19 June 1566 -- 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch . ",0,1.4500000000000002,7,54,261,39,222

Tangled is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy-comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Loosely based on the German fairy tale `` Rapunzel '' in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm , it is the 50th Disney animated feature film . Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi , the film tells the story of a lost , young princess with long magical hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower . Against her mother 's wishes , she accepts the aid of a handsome intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen .   Before the film 's release , its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film as gender-neutral . Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $ 260 million , which if accurate , would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fifth most-expensive film of all time . The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting . Composer Alan Menken , who had worked on prior Disney animated features , returned to score Tangled .   Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14 , 2010 , and went into general release on November 24 . The film was well received by critics and audiences alike . The film earned $ 591 million in worldwide box office revenue , $ 200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada . The film was nominated for a number of awards , including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards . The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29 , 2011 ; a short film , Tangled Ever After , was released later in 2012 and a television series premiered in 2017 .

Anne Rice ( born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien ; October 4 , 1941 ) is an American author of gothic fiction , Christian literature , and erotica . She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels , The Vampire Chronicles , revolving around the central character of Lestat . Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations , Interview with the Vampire in 1994 , and Queen of the Damned in 2002 .   Born in New Orleans , Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas , and later to San Francisco . She was raised in an observant Catholic family , but became an agnostic as a young adult . She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to [ her ] life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .   In addition to her vampire novels , Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints ( adapted for television in 2001 ) and Servant of the Bones , which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries . Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers . Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N.

Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , ( ; 13 October 1925 -- 8 April 2013 ) was a British stateswoman , who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and as Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher ( of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire ) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist . 
Thatcherism describes the conviction politics , economic , social policy and political style of the British Conservative Party politician Margaret Thatcher , who was leader of her party from 1975 to 1990 . It has also been used to describe the beliefs of the British government under Thatcher as Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990 , and beyond into the governments of John Major , Tony Blair and David Cameron . An exponent or supporter of Thatcherism is regarded as a Thatcherite .   Thatcherism represented a systematic , decisive rejection and reversal of the post-war consensus , whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism , the welfare state , nationalised industry , and close regulation of the economy . There was one major exception : the National Health Service , which was widely popular . She promised Britons in 1982 , the NHS is `` safe in our hands '' .   Both the exact terms of what makes up Thatcherism as well as its specific legacy in terms of British history over the past decades are controversial . In terms of ideology , Thatcherism has been described by Nigel Lawson , Thatcher 's Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1983 to 1989 , as a political platform emphasising free markets with restrained government spending and tax cuts coupled with British nationalism both at home and abroad . The Daily Telegraph stated in April 2008 that the programme of the next non-conservative British government , Tony Blair 's administration with an emphasis on ` New Labour ' , basically accepted the central reform measures of Thatcherism such as deregulation , privatisation of key national industries , maintaining a flexible labour market , marginalising the trade unions , and centralising power from local authorities to central government .

Keith Rupert Murdoch [ ˈmɜrdɒk ] , AC , KCSG ( born 11 March 1931 ) is an Australian-born American media mogul . His father , Sir Keith Murdoch , had been a reporter , editor , and senior executive of the Herald and Weekly Times newspaper publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales . After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited . Murdoch thus had full control as Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation , now the world 's second-largest media conglomerate , and its successors , News Corp and 21st Century Fox , after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013 .   In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen ( and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship ) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens . Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International . On 1 July 2015 , Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox . Murdoch and his family own both 21st Century Fox and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust .

Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , ( 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 ) was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis ( of which he had been one of the architects ) , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community .   Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth .   Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage .

Starrcade was an annual professional wrestling event , originally broadcast via closed-circuit television and eventually broadcast via pay-per-view television , held from 1983 to 2000 by the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) and later World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) . Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year , much in the same vein that its rival , the World Wrestling Entertainment , regards WrestleMania . As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .   From 1983 to 1987 , Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions ( JCP ) , the dominant promotion of the NWA , and aired on Thanksgiving Day . In 1987 , the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own , Survivor Series , on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event . In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum . In 1983 , JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition , and spread it across its territory on closed-circuit television . It popularized broadcasting on closed-circuit television and was financially successful . From 1987 , Starrcade was broadcast on pay-per-view , the first NWA event to do so .   The rights to the event now belong to WWE ( formerly the World Wrestling Federation ) . In November 2008 , WWE 24/7 Classics aired a special as a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the event called The Essential Starrcade .

In Fall Gelb ( Case Yellow ) , German armoured units pushed through the Ardennes and then along the Somme valley , cutting off and surrounding the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium , to meet the expected German invasion . When British , Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the mobile and well-organised German operation , the British evacuated the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) and several French divisions from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo .   After the withdrawal of the BEF , the German forces began Fall Rot ( Case Red ) on 5 June . The sixty remaining French divisions made a determined resistance but were unable to overcome the German air superiority and armoured mobility . German tanks outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France . German forces occupied Paris unopposed on 14 June after a chaotic period of flight of the French government that led to a collapse of the French army . German commanders met with French officials on 18 June with the goal of forcing the new French government to accept an armistice that amounted to surrender .   On 22 June , the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed by France and Germany , which resulted in a division of France . The neutral Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain superseded the Third Republic and Germany occupied the north and west . Italy took control a small occupation zone in the south-east and the Vichy regime was left in control of unoccupied territory in the south known as the zone libre . The Germans occupied the zone under Fall Anton in November 1942 , until the Allied liberation in the summer of 1944 . ",0,0.77,4,17,110,130,890

An archipelagic state is any internationally recognized state or country that comprises a series of islands that form an archipelago . The term is defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to define what borders such states should be allowed to claim .   In various conferences , Fiji , Indonesia , Papua New Guinea , the Bahamas , and the Philippines are the five sovereign states that obtained approval in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea signed in Montego Bay , Jamaica on December 10 , 1982 and qualified as archipelagic states .   Archipelagic states are states that are composed of groups of islands forming a state as a single unit , with the islands and the waters within the baselines as internal waters . Under this concept ( `` archipelagic doctrine '' ) , an archipelago shall be regarded as a single unit , so that the waters around , between , and connecting the islands of the archipelago , irrespective of their breadth and dimensions , form part of the internal waters of the state , and are subject to its exclusive sovereignty .   The approval of the United Nations for the five sovereign states as archipelagic states respect existing agreements with other countries and shall recognize traditional fishing rights and other legitimate activities of the immediately adjacent neighboring countries in certain areas falling within archipelagic waters . The terms and conditions for the exercise of such rights and activities , including the nature , the extent and the areas to which they apply , shall , at the request of any of the countries concerned , be regulated by bilateral agreements between them . Such rights shall not be transferred to or shared with third countries or their nationals . 
The Bahamas ( [ bəˈhɑːməz ] ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago . It consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands ; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The designation of `` the Bahamas '' can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands . As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force , the Bahamas territory encompasses 180000 sqmi of ocean space .   The Bahamas is the site of Columbus ' first landfall in the New World in 1492 . At that time , the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people . Although the Spanish never colonised the Bahamas , they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola . The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera .   The Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American War of Independence , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas ; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period . The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves : the Royal Navy resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships ; American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida ; and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather . Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 . Today the descendants of slaves and free Africans make up nearly 90 % of the population ; issues related to the slavery years are part of society .   The Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973 , retaining Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch . In terms of gross domestic product per capita , the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas ( following the United States and Canada ) , with an economy based on tourism and finance .

Peru , is a country in western South America . It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river .   Peruvian territory was home to ancient cultures spanning from the Norte Chico civilization in Caral ( one of the oldest in the world with settlements as old as 3200 BC ) to the Inca Empire , the largest state in Pre-Columbian America . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima , which included most of its South American colonies . Ideas of political autonomy later spread throughout Spanish America and Peru gained its independence , which was formally proclaimed in 1821 after the occupation by military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar and only after the battle of Ayacucho , three years after proclamation , Peru ensured its independence . After achieving independence , the country remained in recession and kept a low military profile until an economic rise based on the extraction of raw and maritime materials struck the country , which ended shortly before the war of the Pacific . Subsequently , the country has undergone changes in government from oligarchic to democratic systems . Peru has gone through periods of political unrest and internal conflict as well as periods of stability and economic upswing .   Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions . It is a developing country with a high Human Development Index score and a poverty level around 25.8 percent . Its main economic activities include mining , manufacturing , agriculture and fishing .   The Peruvian population , estimated at 31.2 million in 2015 , is multiethnic , including Amerindians , Europeans , Africans and Asians . The main spoken language is Spanish , although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechua or other native languages . This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art , cuisine , literature , and music .   __ TOC __ 
Argentina ( [ ɑrdʒənˈtiːnə ] [ aɾxenˈtina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic ( República Argentina ) , is a federal republic in the southern portion of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2780400 km2 , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the second largest in Latin America , and the largest Spanish-speaking one . The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad autónoma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( [ Capital Federal , links = no ] ) as decided by Congress .  The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system .   Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( [ Islas Malvinas , links = no ] ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810 -- 1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with massive waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook . The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century .   After 1930 , Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crises that pushed it back into underdevelopment , though it nevertheless remained among the fifteen richest countries until the mid-20th century . Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs , and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America . Argentina has the second largest economy in South America , the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies . It is also a founding member of the United Nations , World Bank , World Trade Organization , Mercosur , Union of South American Nations , Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States . It is the country with the second highest Human Development Index in Latin America with a rating of `` very high '' . Because of its stability , market size and growing high-tech sector , Argentina is classified as a high-income economy . 
Chile , is a South American country occupying a long , narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west . It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández , Salas y Gómez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica , although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty .   The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .   Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing . The regime , headed by Augusto Pinochet , ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010 .   Chile is today one of South America 's most stable and prosperous nations . It leads Latin American nations in rankings of human development , competitiveness , income per capita , globalization , state of peace , economic freedom , and low perception of corruption . It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state , and democratic development . Chile is a founding member of the United Nations , the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) . 
The Drake Passage or Mar de Hoces -- Sea of Hoces -- is the body of water between South America 's Cape Horn and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica . It connects the southwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean ( Scotia Sea ) with the southeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and extends into the Southern Ocean . 
Bolivia ( [ bəˈlɪviə ] [ boˈliβi̯a ] ; Buliwya [ bʊlɪwja ] Wuliwya [ - allwʊlɪwja ] Mborivia [ ᵐboˈɾiʋja ] ) , officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia ( Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia ) , is a landlocked country located in western-central South America . It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil , to the southeast by Paraguay , to the south by Argentina , to the southwest by Chile , and to the northwest by Peru . One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range , with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers , El Alto , located on the Altiplano . Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries ( the other is Paraguay ) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia . Bolivia is geographically the largest landlocked country in the Americas , but remains a relatively small country in economic and military terms .   Before Spanish colonization , the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire , while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes . Spanish conquistadors arriving from Cuzco and Asunción took control of the region in the 16th century . During the Spanish colonial period Bolivia was administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas . Spain built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from Bolivia 's mines .   After the first call for independence in 1809 , 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic , named for Simón Bolívar , on 6 August 1825 . Since independence , Bolivia has endured periods of political and economic instability , including the loss of various peripheral territories to its neighbors , such as Acre and parts of the Gran Chaco . It has been landlocked since the annexation of its Pacific coast territory by Chile following the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 84 ) , but agreements with neighboring countries have granted it indirect access to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .   The country 's population , estimated at 11 million , is multiethnic , including Amerindians , Mestizos , Europeans , Asians and Africans . The racial and social segregation that arose from Spanish colonialism has continued to the modern era . Spanish is the official and predominant language , although 36 indigenous languages also have official status , of which the most commonly spoken are Guarani , Aymara and Quechua languages .   Modern Bolivia is constitutionally a unitary state , divided into nine departments . Its geography varies from the peaks of the Andes in the West , to the Eastern Lowlands , situated within the Amazon Basin . It is a developing country , with a medium ranking in the Human Development Index and a poverty level of 53 percent . Its main economic activities include agriculture , forestry , fishing , mining , and manufacturing goods such as textiles , clothing , refined metals , and refined petroleum . Bolivia is very wealthy in minerals , especially tin . ",0,0.35,3,4,29,293,2451

Ed Wood is a 1994 American biographical period comedy-drama film directed and produced by Tim Burton , and starring Johnny Depp as cult filmmaker Ed Wood . The film concerns the period in Wood 's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi , played by Martin Landau . Sarah Jessica Parker , Patricia Arquette , Jeffrey Jones , Lisa Marie , and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast .   The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts . Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel , Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic , and Michael Lehmann as director . Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads , Lehmann had to vacate the director 's position , which was taken over by Burton .   Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures , but the studio put the film in `` turnaround '' over Burton 's decision to shoot in black-and-white . Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios , which produced the film through the studio 's Touchstone Pictures division . The film was released to critical acclaim , but was a box office bomb , making only $ 5.9 million against an $ 18 million budget . It won two Academy Awards : Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker ( who designed Landau 's prosthetic makeup ) , Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng . 
The Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling is the Academy Award given to the best achievement in makeup and hair-styling for film . Usually , only three films are nominated each year rather than five as in most categories . The exception is in the early 1980s as well as 2002 , when there were only two nominees ; and in 1999 , when there were four nominees .   The competitive category was created in 1981 as the Academy Award for Best Makeup , after the Academy received complaints that the make-up work in The Elephant Man ( 1980 ) was not going to be honored . Although no award was given to The Elephant Man , an entire category dedicated to honoring make-up effects in film was created for subsequent ceremonies .

Touchstone Pictures is an American film distribution label of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures . Previously , Touchstone operated as an active film production banner of Walt Disney Studios , owned by The Walt Disney Company . Established on February 15 , 1984 by then-Disney CEO Ron W. Miller as Touchstone Films , it typically releases films targeted to adult audiences with more mature themes and darker tones than those released under the Disney name . Touchstone Pictures merely serves as a brand and not a distinct business operation , and does not exist as a separate company .   In 2009 , Disney entered into a 5-year , 30-picture distribution deal with DreamWorks Pictures by which DreamWorks ' productions would be released through the Touchstone banner . Touchstone then distributed DreamWorks ' films from 2011 to 2016 . 
In the motion picture industry , a `` box office bomb '' or `` box office flop '' is a film that is considered highly unsuccessful or unprofitable during its theatrical run , often following significant hype regarding its cost , production , or marketing efforts . Generally , any film for which the production and marketing costs exceed the combined revenue recovered after release is considered to have `` bombed '' .   Gauging the financial success of a film is difficult , and because there is no reliable definition , what makes a box-office bomb can be very subjective . Not all films that fail to earn back their estimated costs during their theatrical runs are bombs , and the label is generally applied to films that miss earnings projections by a wide margin , particularly when they are very expensive to produce , and sometimes in conjunction with middling or poor reviews ( though critical reception has an imperfect connection to box office performance ) .

Diwali or Deepavali is the Hindu festival of lights celebrated every year in autumn in the northern hemisphere ( spring in southern hemisphere ) . It is an official holiday in Fiji , Guyana , India , Malaysia , Mauritius , Myanmar , Nepal , Singapore , Sri Lanka , Suriname , Trinidad and Tobago , and recently Sindh Province in Pakistan . One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism , it spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness , good over evil , knowledge over ignorance , and hope over despair . Its celebration includes millions of lights shining on housetops , outside doors and windows , around temples and other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed . The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period , but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with the darkest , new moon night of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika in Bikram Sambat calendar . In the Gregorian calendar , Diwali night falls between mid-October and mid-November .   Before Diwali night , people clean , renovate , and decorate their homes and offices . On Diwali night , people dress up in new clothes or their best outfit , light up diyas ( lamps and candles ) inside and outside their home , participate in family puja ( prayers ) typically to Lakshmi -- the goddess of fertility and prosperity . After puja , fireworks follow , then a family feast including mithai ( sweets ) , and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends . Deepavali also marks a major shopping period in nations where it is celebrated .   The name of festive days as well as the rituals of Diwali vary significantly among Hindus , based on the region of India . In many parts of India , the festivities start with Dhanteras ( in Northern and Western part of India ) , followed by Naraka Chaturdasi on second day , Deepavali on the third day , Diwali Padva dedicated to wife -- husband relationship on the fourth day , and festivities end with Bhai Dooj dedicated to sister -- brother bond on the fifth day . Dhanteras usually falls eighteen days after Dussehra .   On the same night that Hindus celebrate Diwali , Jains celebrate a festival also called Diwali to mark the attainment of moksha by Mahavira , Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal Empire prison , and Newar Buddhists , unlike the majority of Buddhists , celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi .

Libya is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa , bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north , Egypt to the east , Sudan to the southeast , Chad and Niger to the south and Algeria and Tunisia to the west . The country is made of three historical regions , Tripolitania , Fezzan and Cyrenaica . With an area of almost 1.8 e6km2 , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa , and is the 16th largest country in the world . Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world .   The largest city and capital , Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya 's six million people . The other large city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya .   Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age . The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya , and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya . Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire . Libya was an early centre of Christianity . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century , when invasions brought Islam and Arab colonisation . In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 . Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries . Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943 . During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign . The Italian population then went into decline . Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951 .   A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I , beginning a period of sweeping social reform . The most prominent coup figure , Muammar Gaddafi , was ultimately able to have power fully concentrated in his hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution , remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011 , fought by those supporting the government and by forces attempting to overthrow it , in which the rebels were supported by NATO . Since then , Libya has experienced a period of instability . The European Union is involved in an operation intended to disrupt human trafficking networks exploiting refugees fleeing from wars in Africa for Europe .   As part of the ongoing second Libyan Civil War ( 2014 -- present ) , at least two political bodies claim to be the government of Libya . The Council of Deputies is one such government , but it does not hold territory in the capital , Tripoli , instead meeting in the Cyrenaica city of Tobruk . Meanwhile , the UN-backed 2014 General National Congress purports to be the legal continuation of the General National Congress , elected in the 2012 Libyan General National Congress election and dissolved following the June 2014 elections but then reconvened by a minority of its members . The Supreme Court in the Libya Dawn and General National Congress-controlled Tripoli declared the Tobruk government unconstitutional in November 2014 , but the body has rejected the ruling as made under threat of violence .   Parts of Libya are outside of either government 's control , with various Islamist , rebel , and tribal militias administering some cities and areas . The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between the Tobruk - and Tripoli-based factions . An agreement to form a unified interim government was signed on 17 December 2015 . Under the terms of the agreement , a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would be formed , with a view to holding new elections within two years . The leaders of the new government , called the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) , arrived in Tripoli on 5 April 2016 . Since then the GNC , one of the two rival governments , has disbanded to support the new GNA . ",0,0.7000000000000001,5,23,83,54,391

Alice Cooper ( born Vincent Damon Furnier ; February 4 , 1948 ) is an American singer , songwriter , and actor whose career spans over five decades . With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper . ",0,1.0,4,23,65,65,368

Sarah Jessica Parker , Patricia Arquette , Jeffrey Jones , Lisa Marie , and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast .   The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts . Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel , Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic , and Michael Lehmann as director . Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads , Lehmann had to vacate the director 's position , which was taken over by Burton .   Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures , but the studio put the film in `` turnaround '' over Burton 's decision to shoot in black-and-white . Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios , which produced the film through the studio 's Touchstone Pictures division . The film was released to critical acclaim , but was a box office bomb , making only $ 5.9 million against an $ 18 million budget . It won two Academy Awards : Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker ( who designed Landau 's prosthetic makeup ) , Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng . ",0,0.56,4,11,72,109,968

Yale University is an American private Ivy League research university in New Haven , Connecticut . Founded in 1701 , it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States .   Chartered by Connecticut Colony , the `` Collegiate School '' was established by clergy in Saybrook Colony to educate Congregationalist ministers . It moved to New Haven in 1716 , and shortly after was renamed Yale College in recognition of a gift from British East India Company governor Elihu Yale . Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages , the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution . In the 19th century the school introduced graduate and professional instruction , awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887 . Its faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research .   Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools : the original undergraduate college , the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , and twelve professional schools . While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation , each school 's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs . In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven , the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven , a campus in West Haven , Connecticut , and forest and nature preserves throughout New England . The university 's assets include an endowment valued at $ 25.4 billion as of June 2016 , the second largest of any U.S. educational institution . The Yale University Library , serving all constituent schools , holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States .   Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and are organized into a social system of residential colleges . Almost all faculty teach undergraduate courses , more than 2,000 of which are offered annually . Students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I -- Ivy League .

Speech recognition ( SR ) is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers . It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems . These speech industry players include Google , Microsoft , IBM , Baidu , Apple , Amazon , Nuance , SoundHound , IflyTek , CDAC many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning .

Guatemala ( [ ɡwɑːtᵻˈmɑːlə , _ ɡwæ - , _ ɡɑː - ] , or ; [ gwateˈmala ] ) , officially the Republic of Guatemala ( [ República de Guatemala , links = no ] ) , is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west , the Pacific Ocean to the southwest , Belize to the northeast , the Caribbean to the east , Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast . With an estimated population of around 15.8 million , it is the most populated state in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción , also known as Guatemala City .   The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved in 1841 .   From the mid to late 19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms .

In 1804 , the last full year of his single term as vice president , Burr killed his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a famous duel . Burr was never tried for the illegal duel , and all charges against him were eventually dropped , but Hamilton 's death ended Burr 's political career .   After leaving Washington , Burr traveled west seeking new opportunities , both economic and political . His activities eventually led to his arrest on charges of treason in 1807 . The subsequent trial resulted in acquittal , but Burr 's western schemes left him with large debts and few influential friends . In a final quest for grand opportunities , he left the United States for Europe . He remained overseas until 1812 , when he returned to the United States to practice law in New York City .

Creedence Clearwater Revival , often informally abbreviated to Creedence or CCR , was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s . The band consisted of lead vocalist , lead guitarist , and primary songwriter John Fogerty , his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty , bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford .

The band performed at 1969 's famed Woodstock Festival .   After four years of chart-topping success , the group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 . Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year , and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control , all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits between the former bandmates . Fogerty 's ongoing disagreements with Saul Zaentz , owner of their label Fantasy Records , created further protracted court battles . As a result , John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving former members at CCR 's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .

Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh declared independence from France on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh , led by Ho . The Viet Minh ( `` League for the Independence of Vietnam '' ) was a coalition of nationalist groups , mostly led by communists . In February 1951 , the communists announced the creation of the Lao Động Party ( Labor Party ) , gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Việt Minh .   Between 1946 and 1954 , the Việt Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam . In 1954 , after the French were defeated , the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Việt Minh and granted Vietnam independence . The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones , and stipulated general elections in July 1956 `` to bring about the unification of Viet-Nam '' . The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam , and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam .   Supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India , Canada and Poland . The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords but instead stated that the U.S. `` shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly . '' In July 1955 , the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam , Ngô Đình Diệm , announced that the Republic of Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country . He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva accords and was not bound by it .   With the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War ( 1955 -- 75 ) . North Vietnam and the Việt Cộng insurgents supported by their communist allies , including the Soviet Union and China , fought against the military of South Vietnam , the U.S. and other anti-communist military forces , including South Korea , Australia , Thailand and smaller players . North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments . The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Việt Cộng defeated the Republic of Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam .

Aleister Crowley ( [ ˈkroʊli ] born Edward Alexander Crowley ; 12 October 1875 -- 1 December 1947 ) was an English occultist , ceremonial magician , poet , painter , novelist , and mountaineer . He founded the religion of Thelema , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century . A prolific writer , he published widely over the course of his life .   Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism . He was educated at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry , resulting in several publications . Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life . In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India . He married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honeymooned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who provided him with The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema . Announcing the start of the Æon of Horus , The Book declared that its followers should `` Do what thou wilt '' and seek to align themselves with their True Will through the practice of magick .   After an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga and a visit to India and China , Crowley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature . In 1907 , he and George Cecil Jones co-founded a Thelemite order , the A ∴ A ∴ , through which they propagated the religion . After spending time in Algeria , in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order , the German-based Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) , rising to become the leader of its British branch , which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs . Through the O.T.O. , Thelemite groups were established in Britain , Australia , and North America . Crowley spent the First World War in the United States , where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain , later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services . In 1920 he established the Abbey of Thelema , a religious commune in Cefalù , Sicily where he lived with various followers . His libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press , and the Italian government evicted him in 1923 . He divided the following two decades between France , Germany , and England , and continued to promote Thelema until his death .   Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime , being a recreational drug experimenter , bisexual and an individualist social critic . He was denounced in the popular press as `` the wickedest man in the world '' and a Satanist . Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter-culture , and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema . In 2002 , a BBC poll ranked him as the seventy-third greatest Briton of all time . ",0,0.79,3,22,63,82,418

Thomas Jefferson ( April 13 [ O.S. April 2 ] 1743 -- July 4 , 1826 ) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 . Previously , he was elected the second Vice President of the United States , serving under John Adams from 1797 to 1801 . A proponent of democracy , republicanism , and individual rights motivating American colonists to break from Great Britain and form a new nation , he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level . He was a land owner and farmer .   Jefferson was primarily of English ancestry , born and educated in colonial Virginia . He graduated from the College of William & Mary and briefly practiced law , at times defending slaves seeking their freedom . During the American Revolution , he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration , drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator , and he served as a wartime governor ( 1779 -- 1781 ) . He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785 , and subsequently the nation 's first Secretary of State in 1790 -- 1793 under President George Washington . Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System . With Madison , he anonymously wrote the controversial Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 -- 1799 , which sought to embolden states ' rights in opposition to the national government by nullifying the Alien and Sedition Acts .   As President , Jefferson pursued the nation 's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies . He also organized the Louisiana Purchase , almost doubling the country 's territory . As a result of peace negotiations with France , his administration reduced military forces . He was reelected in 1804 . Jefferson 's second term was beset with difficulties at home , including the trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr . American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act of 1807 , responding to British threats to U.S. shipping . In 1803 , Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized Louisiana Territory , and he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807 .   Jefferson mastered many disciplines , which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics . He was a proven architect in the classical tradition . Jefferson 's keen interest in religion and philosophy earned him the presidency of the American Philosophical Society . He shunned organized religion , but was influenced by both Christianity and deism . He was well versed in linguistics and spoke several languages . He founded the University of Virginia after retiring from public office . He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent and important people throughout his adult life . His only full-length book is Notes on the State of Virginia ( 1785 ) , considered the most important American book published before 1800 .   Jefferson owned several plantations which were worked by hundreds of slaves . Most historians now believe that , after the death of his wife in 1782 , he had a relationship with his slave Sally Hemings and fathered at least one of her children . Historians have lauded Jefferson 's public life , noting his primary authorship of the Declaration of Independence during the Revolutionary War , his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia , and the Louisiana Purchase while he was president . Various modern scholars are more critical of Jefferson 's private life , pointing out the discrepancy between his ownership of slaves and his liberal political principles , for example . Presidential scholars , however , consistently rank Jefferson among the greatest presidents . ",0,1.0,4,33,131,37,216

Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal ( with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God ) and nu metal ( with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park ) , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles , including multiple genres of heavy metal . rarely features guitar solos ; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs . Many nu metal guitarists use that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound . DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling , turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds . Vocal styles in include singing , rapping , screaming and growling . Nu metal is one of the key genres of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal .   Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s with bands and artists such as Korn , Limp Bizkit , Slipknot , and Deftones all releasing multi-platinum albums . Nu metal 's popularity continued during the early 2000s , with bands such as Papa Roach , Staind , and P.O.D. all selling multi-platinum albums , and came to a peak with Linkin Park 's diamond-selling album Hybrid Theory . However , by the the oversaturation of bands combined with the under-performance of a number of releases led to nu metal 's decline , leading to the rise of metalcore and many nu metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres .   During the 2010s , there has been a slight nu metal revival ; many bands that combine nu metal with other genres ( for example , metalcore ) emerged and some nu metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to a nu metal sound . Many heavy metal fans have criticized nu metal , and do not regard it as `` true heavy metal '' . Many musicians have rejected the nu metal label and also have rejected being labeled as heavy metal .

850,Morse code is more sensitive to poor signal conditions.,"[['Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device .', 'Morse_code', 18, []]]","
Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones , lights , or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment . It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals ( prosigns ) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character ( letter or numeral ) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots ( one dash ) , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty . ",0,0.7000000000000001,5,42,161,71,311

Henry II ( Henri II 31 March 1519 -- 10 July 1559 ) was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 31 March 1547 until his death in 1559 . The second son of Francis I , he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis III , Duke of Brittany , in 1536 .   As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father . Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion . He persevered in the Italian Wars against the House of Habsburg and tried to suppress the Protestant Reformation , even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign .   The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis ( 1559 ) , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics . France failed to change the balance of power in Europe , as Spain remained the sole dominant power , but it did benefit from the division of the holdings of its ruler , Charles V , and from the weakening of the Holy Roman Empire , which Charles also ruled .   Henry suffered an untimely death in a jousting tournament held to celebrate the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis at the conclusion of the Eighth Italian War . The king 's surgeon , Ambroise Paré , was unable to cure the infected wound inflicted by Gabriel de Montgomery , the captain of his Scottish Guard .

Wales ( [ ˈweɪlz ] Cymru [ ˈkəm.rɨ ] ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was # 45.5 billion ( # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team .

Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal ( with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God ) and nu metal ( with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park ) , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

''   In the mid-1960s , after attending Kent State University , Walsh played with several local Ohio-based bands before reaching a national audience as a member of the James Gang , whose hit song `` Funk # 49 '' highlighted his skill as both a guitarist and vocalist . After the James Gang broke up in 1972 , he formed Barnstorm with Joe Vitale , a college friend from Ohio , and Kenny Passarelli , a bassist from Colorado , where Walsh had moved after leaving Ohio . While the band stayed together for three albums over three years , its works were marketed as Walsh solo projects . The last Barnstorm album , 1974 's So What contained significant guest contributions from several members of the Eagles , a group that had recently hired Walsh 's producer , Bill Szymczyk .   At Szymczyk 's suggestion , Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as the group 's keyboardist and guitarist following the departure of their founding member Bernie Leadon , with Hotel California being his first album with the band . In 1998 a reader 's poll conducted by Guitarist magazine selected the guitar solos on the track `` Hotel California '' by he and Don Felder as the best guitar solos of all time . Guitar World magazine listed it at eighth of the Top 100 Guitar Solos .   Besides his work with his several bands , he has released twelve solo studio albums , six compilation albums and two live albums . His solo hits include `` Rocky Mountain Way '' , `` Life 's Been Good '' , `` All Night Long '' , `` A Life of Illusion '' and `` Ordinary Average Guy '' .   As a member of the Eagles , Walsh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 , and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 . The Eagles are considered to be one of the most influential bands of the 1970s , and they remain the best-selling American band in the history of popular music . His creative contribution to music has received praise from many of the best rock guitarists , including Led Zeppelin 's Jimmy Page , who said , `` He has a tremendous feel for the instrument . I 've loved his style since the early James Gang . '' Eric Clapton said that `` He 's one of the best guitarists to surface in some time . I do n't listen to many records , but I listen to his . '' The Who 's guitarist , Pete Townshend , said `` Joe Walsh is a fluid and intelligent player . There 're not many like that around . '' ",0,0.8600000000000001,3,7,14,101,1133

The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus . It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior .   Horses ' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .   Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament : spirited `` hot bloods '' with speed and endurance ; `` cold bloods '' , such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow , heavy work ; and `` warmbloods '' , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods , often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes , particularly in Europe . There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today , developed for many different uses .   Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits , as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment , and therapy . Horses were historically used in warfare , from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed , using many different styles of equipment and methods of control . Many products are derived from horses , including meat , milk , hide , hair , bone , and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . Humans provide domesticated horses with food , water and shelter , as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers . ",0,1.77,3,29,114,80,370

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . ",0,1.84,9,62,358,96,736

Sir Donald George `` Don '' Bradman , AC ( 27 August 1908 -- 25 February 2001 ) , often referred to as `` The Don '' , was an Australian cricketer , widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time . Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .

The series ' executive producers included Shore , Attanasio , Attanasio 's business partner Katie Jacobs , and film director Bryan Singer . It was filmed largely in Century City .   House often clashes with his fellow physicians , including his own diagnostic team , because many of his hypotheses about patients ' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights .

Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London . They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music . Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics , sonic experimentation , extended compositions and elaborate live shows , they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music .   Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals , Nick Mason on drums , Roger Waters on bass and vocals , and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals . They gained popularity performing in London 's underground music scene during the late 1960s , and under Barrett 's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn ( 1967 ) . Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967 ; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health . Waters became the band 's primary lyricist and conceptual leader , devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark Side of the Moon ( 1973 ) , Wish You Were Here ( 1975 ) , Animals ( 1977 ) , The Wall ( 1979 ) and The Final Cut ( 1983 ) . The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time .   Following creative tensions , Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979 , followed by Waters in 1985 . Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd ; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and , later , a band member . The three produced two more albums -- A Momentary Lapse of Reason ( 1987 ) and The Division Bell ( 1994 ) -- and toured through 1994 . After nearly two decades of acrimony , Gilmour , Wright , and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London as part of the global awareness event Live 8 ; Gilmour and Waters later stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again . Barrett died in 2006 , and Wright in 2008 . The final Pink Floyd studio album , The Endless River ( 2014 ) , was recorded without Waters and based largely on unreleased material .   Pink Floyd were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 .

Aristotle ( [ ˈærɪˌstɒtəl ] Ἀριστοτέλης , [ aristotélɛːs ] , Aristotélēs ; 384 -- 322 BC ) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira , Chalkidice , on the northern periphery of Classical Greece . His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( c. 347 BC ) . His writings cover many subjects -- including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy . Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC .   Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies . He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books . The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism , but , following Plato 's death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism . He believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception . Aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .   Aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century . His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .   In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church . Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' ( [ ) .   His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today . Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .

CBS ( an initialism of the network 's former name , the Columbia Broadcasting System ) is an American English language commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation . The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City ( at the CBS Broadcast Center ) and Los Angeles ( at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center ) .   CBS is sometimes referred to as the `` Eye Network '' , in reference to the company 's iconic logo , in use since 1951 . It has also been called the `` Tiffany Network '' , alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley . It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 .   The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations that was purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 , CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc. . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 , CBS came under the control of Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies , and re-established CBS Corporation -- through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets -- with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controls the current Viacom .   CBS continues to operate the CBS Radio network , which now mainly provides news and features content for its portfolio of owned-and-operated radio stations in large and mid-sized markets , and affiliated radio stations in various other markets .

David Mordechai Packouz ( [ pækhaʊs ] born February 16 , 1982 ) is an American former arms dealer , musician , inventor and entrepreneur .   In 2005 , Packouz ( 23 years old at the time ) joined Efraim Diveroli ( 19 years old at the time ) in Diveroli 's arms company AEY Inc. . By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million . In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions . The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition . Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller . Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .   Packouz went on to invent a guitar pedal drum machine , the BeatBuddy , and is currently the CEO of music technology company Singular Sound . ",0,0.42,3,5,33,48,213

Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored , nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product , service or idea . Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services . Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message . It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal , i.e. , not directed to a particular individual .  Advertising is communicated through various mass media , including old media such as newspapers , magazines , Television , Radio , outdoor advertising or direct mail ; or new media such as search results , blogs , websites or text messages . The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or `` ad '' .   Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through `` branding , '' which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers . On the other hand , ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct response advertising . Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties , interest groups , religious organizations and governmental agencies . Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion , such as a public service announcement . Advertising may also be used to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful .   Modern advertising was created with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s , most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays , considered the founder of modern , `` Madison Avenue '' advertising .

The brainstem ( or brain stem ) is the posterior part of the brain , adjoining and structurally continuous with the spinal cord . In the human brain the brainstem includes the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . Sometimes the diencephalon , the caudal part of the forebrain , is included .   The brainstem provides the main motor and sensory innervation to the face and neck via the cranial nerves . Of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves , ten pairs come from the brainstem . Though small , this is an extremely important part of the brain as the nerve connections of the motor and sensory systems from the main part of the brain to the rest of the body pass through the brainstem . This includes the corticospinal tract ( motor ) , the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway ( fine touch , vibration sensation , and proprioception ) , and the spinothalamic tract ( pain , temperature , itch , and crude touch ) .   The brainstem also plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac and respiratory function . It also regulates the central nervous system , and is pivotal in maintaining consciousness and regulating the sleep cycle . The brainstem has many basic functions including heart rate , breathing , sleeping , and eating . 
The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system . The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , there are also cortical areas associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , a motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with a particular side of the brain , such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts known as commisures , the largest being the corpus callosum .   The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts known as peduncles . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system of the brain , which consists of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .   The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets . These connections form various neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry of the brain is driven by the process of neurotransmission .   The brain is protected by the skull , suspended in cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood -- brain barrier . However , the brain is still susceptible to damage , disease , and infection . Damage can be caused by trauma , or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke . The brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , forms of dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , and multiple sclerosis . A number of psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia and clinical depression , are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions , although the nature of these is not well understood . The brain can also be the site of tumours , both benign and malignant . Malignant tumours mostly originate from sites outside the brain .   The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy , while the study of its function is neuroscience . A number of different techniques are used to study the brain . Brain specimens from other animals , which may be examined microscopically , have been a traditional source of much information . Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography ( EEG ) recordings are important techniques in studying the brain . Examining the medical history of people with brain injury has also provided great insight into the function of each part of the brain . ",0,0.9300000000000002,3,30,122,131,805

Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore , a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota , United States . Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture 's design and oversaw the project 's execution from 1927-1941 with the help of his son , Lincoln Borglum . Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732 -- 1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743 -- 1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858 -- 1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809 -- 1865 ) . The memorial park covers 1278.45 acre and is 5725 ft above sea level .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on Mount Rushmore , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents .   After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project . Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist . Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and it has appeared in works of fiction , as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million visitors annually . 
James Lincoln de la Mothe Borglum ( April 9 , 1912 -- January 27 , 1986 ) was an American sculptor , photographer , author and engineer ; he was best known for overseeing the completion of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial after the death in 1941 of the project 's leader , his father , Gutzon Borglum . One of his best-known works , a bust of his father , is on display outside the Lincoln Borglum Visitors Center at Mount Rushmore . ",0,2.1500000000000004,6,47,225,274,1506

Michigan [ ˈmɪʃᵻgən ] is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States .

Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry .

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . 
This is a list of the 565 municipalities in the U.S. state of New Jersey , ordered by population . There are five types of municipality in the state -- boroughs ( 250 ) , cities ( 52 ) , towns ( 15 ) , townships ( 245 ) , and villages ( 4 ) . New Jersey , the fourth-smallest state , covers 8722 sqmi , meaning the average land size of a municipality in the state is about 15 sqmi -- but note the wide range of actual sizes in the map at right .

140,Folklore excludes proverbs.,"[['These include oral traditions such as tales , proverbs and jokes .', 'Folklore', 1, ['Narrative', 'tales', 'proverbs', 'jokes', 'oral traditions']]]","
Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people ; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture , subculture or group . These include oral traditions such as tales , proverbs and jokes . They include material culture , ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group . Folklore also includes customary lore , the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings , folk dances and initiation rites . Each one of these , either singly or in combination , is considered a folklore artifact . Just as essential as the form , folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next . For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts . Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration . The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics .   To fully understand folklore , it is helpful to clarify its component parts : the terms folk and lore . It is well-documented that the term was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms . He fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of `` popular antiquities '' or `` popular literature '' . The second half of the compound word , lore , proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries . Coming from Old English lār ` instruction , ' and with German and Dutch cognates , it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group , frequently passed along by word of mouth .   The concept of folk proves somewhat more elusive . When Thoms first created this term , folk applied only to rural , frequently poor and illiterate peasants . A more modern definition of folk is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits , who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions . `` Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in American folklore or to a single family . '' This expanded social definition of folk supports a broader view of the material , i.e. the lore , considered to be folklore artifacts . These now include all `` things people make with words ( verbal lore ) , things they make with their hands ( material lore ) , and things they make with their actions ( customary lore ) '' . Folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete . The folklorist studies the traditional artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted .   Transmission is a vital part of the folklore process . Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time , they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists . For folklore is also a verb . These folk artifacts continue to be passed along informally , as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants . The folk group is not individualistic , it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community . `` As new groups emerge , new folklore is created ... surfers , motorcyclists , computer programmers '' . In direct contrast to high culture , where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law , folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group .   Having identified folk artifacts , the professional folklorist strives to understand the significance of these beliefs , customs and objects for the group . For these cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group . That meaning can however shift and morph . So Halloween of the 21st century is not the All Hallows ' Eve of the Middle Ages , and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration . The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water ; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew . Compare this to brushing your teeth , also transmitted within a group , which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition . For tradition is initially remembered behavior . Once it loses its practical purpose , there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action . This meaning is at the core of folkloristics , the study of folklore .   With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences , it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group , it is indeed all around us . It does not have to be old or antiquated . It continues to be created , transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between `` us '' and `` them '' . ",0,0.5800000000000001,2,8,36,25,173

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront .

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease and motor neurone disease ( MND ) , is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles . Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common . ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life . The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50 . The average survival from onset to death is two to four years . About 10 % survive longer than 10 years . Most die from respiratory failure . In much of the world , rates of ALS are unknown . In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year .   Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell . In 1869 , the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot , who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking , diagnosed in 1963 and expected to die within two years , became famous . In 2014 , videos of the ice bucket challenge went viral on the World Wide Web and increased public awareness of the condition . ",0,1.0,5,36,123,67,320

The Quran ( [ kɔrˈɑːn ] ; القرآن , literally meaning `` the recitation '' ; also romanized Qur ` an or Koran ) is the central religious text of Islam , which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God ( Allah ) . It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir . ",0,0.35,3,3,12,51,401

Michigan [ ˈmɪʃᵻgən ] is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States .

Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry .

The term `` microbiologist '' comes from the Greek mīkros meaning `` small '' βίος , and bios , meaning `` life '' - λογία , combined with - logia meaning one who studies . A microbiologist ( from Greek μῑκρος ) is a biological scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes or works in the field of microbiology . Microbiologists investigate the growth , interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria , algae , fungi , and some types of parasites and their vectors . They contribute much to the field by trying to understand and learn about the interaction between these microbes and the environment and also among themselves and other organisms . Most microbiologists are qualified to work in offices and/or research facilities , such as a laboratory as well as in the academia . There , they conduct experiments that help them analyze microbes and their importance . A microbiologist 's work is often repeated or improved in order to establish accurate research . Most microbiologists specialize in environmental , food , agricultural , industrial or medical aspects of microbiology including : virology ( the study of viruses ) ; immunology ( the study of mechanisms that fight infections ) ; bioinformatics ( the methods for storing , retrieving , organizing and analyzing biological data ) and Bioremediation ( using microbes as environmental mitigation strategies ) . Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance the understanding of cell reproduction and human disease . Some microbiologists have contributed to knowledge of pathogens and disease-causing microbes . While others , study their interaction with the environment and their use as potential environmental pollution cleaners .   Microbiology is a specific subset of science that often overlaps with other subjects surrounding biology . Because microbiologists specialize in the investigation of microorganisms that typically cause infection , their research commonly promotes information found in immunology , pathology , and molecular biology .

So You Think You Can Dance is an American televised dance competition show that airs on Fox in the United States and is the flagship series of the international So You Think You Can Dance television franchise . It was created by American Idol producers Simon Fuller and Nigel Lythgoe and is produced by 19 Entertainment , Dick Clark Productions and Conrad Sewell Productions . The series premiered on July 20 , 2005 with over ten million viewers and ended the summer season as the top-rated show on television . The first season was hosted by American news personality Lauren Sánchez . Since the second season , it has been hosted by former British children 's television personality and game show emcee Cat Deeley . During its second season , the program remained the No. 1 rated summer show ( adults aged 18 -- 49 ) , but it has declined in ratings since .   The show features a tiered format wherein dancers trained in a variety of dance genres enter open auditions held in a number of major U.S. cities to showcase their talents and may move forward through successive additional rounds of auditions to test their ability to adapt to different styles . At the end of this process , a small number of dancers are chosen as finalists . These dancers move on to the competition 's main phase , where they perform solo , duet , and group dance numbers on live television . They compete for the votes of the broadcast viewing audience which , combined with the input of a panel of judges , determines which dancers advance to the next stage from week to week . The number of finalists has varied as determined by a season 's format , but has often been 20 contestants .   Competitors attempt to master various dance styles , including classical , contemporary , ballroom , hip-hop , street , club , jazz , and musical theatre styles , among others . These are usually assigned by a luck-of-the-draw system during the successive weeks of elimination . The eventual champion wins a cash prize ( typically $ 250,000 ) and the title `` America 's Favorite Dancer '' . In thirteen seasons , the winners have been Nick Lazzarini , Benjamin `` Benji '' Schwimmer , Sabra Johnson , Joshua Allen , Jeanine Mason , Russell Ferguson , Lauren Froderman , Melanie Moore , Eliana Girard , Chehon Wespi-Tschopp , Amy Yakima , Du-Shaunt `` Fik-Shun '' Stegall , Ricky Ubeda , Gaby Diaz and Leon `` Kida '' Burns . Girard and Wespi-Tschopp shared the title as dual-winners for the ninth season , and Yakima and Stegall as the winners of the tenth . Since season 7 , finalists have been paired with a So You Think You Can Dance `` All-Star '' as a partner and sometimes a mentor .   The show has won seven Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Choreography and a total of nine Emmy Awards altogether . Licensed variations of the show , produced for broadcast markets in other nations , began airing in August 2005 , and to date 25 localized adaptations of So You Think You Can Dance have been produced in as many countries .

The following is a list of political leaders of North Korea , officially called the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) .   At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union occupied the northern half of Korea and in 1946 established the Provisional People 's Committee for North Korea chaired by Kim Il-sung . On 9 September 1948 , the DPRK was proclaimed , also led by Kim Il-sung .   The supreme leaders of the DPRK have been Kim Il-sung , his son Kim Jong-il , and his grandson Kim Jong-un . In this role they have not held consistent titles , though they were each leaders of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) -- titled as Chairman from 1948 to 1966 , General Secretary from 1966 to 2011 , First Secretary from 2011 to 2016 , and finally Chairman again since 2016 -- for almost all of their period in power . Even though they have the appearance of a dynasty , there is no formal succession .   From 1948 to 1972 , the nominal head of state was the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People 's Assembly ( SPA ) . In 1972 , the constitution was amended to create an executive presidency . Kim Il-sung , who had served as Premier of North Korea since the DPRK 's inception , was unanimously elected President of North Korea by the Supreme People 's Assembly on December 28 . He held this office until his death on 8 July 1994 when he was proclaimed the `` Eternal President of the Republic '' . Since then , the practical functions of the head of state have been exercised by the President of the Presidium of the SPA .   After the death of Kim Il-sung , his son Kim Jong-il was understood to have inherited his father 's near-absolute control over the country . Although he had been his father 's designated successor since at least 1991 , it took him three years to fully consolidate his power . He was elected general secretary of the party in 1997 , and was reelected Chairman of the National Defence Commission ( NDC ) in 1998 . During his rule he was given a range of titles . He ruled the country until his death on 17 December 2011 . He was succeeded by his son , Kim Jong-un , who was revealed to be in charge of the country since his father 's death by the Rodong Sinmun and finally publicly acknowledged as supreme leader at the military review ending Kim Jong-il 's funeral on 29 December 2011 .   The government is headed by the Premier of the Cabinet , formerly called Premier of the Administration Council .   Other important institutions include the SPA , whose sessions are chaired by the Chairman of the Supreme People 's Assembly , and , since 1993 , the Chairman of the NDC , which holds supreme command of the DPRK 's armed forces .   While two other parties , the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party , nominally exist , only the WPK holds any power at the national level . The other parties , and indeed all other mass organizations in the country , are completely subservient to the WPK . They exist solely to keep up the appearance that the country is a pluralist society . Almost nothing is mentioned about the minor parties except the names of their current leaders .   Since 1997 , the SPA chairman , premier and NDC chairman have officially formed a triumvirate heading the executive branch , with powers equivalent to one-third of a president 's powers in other presidential systems . The SPA chairman conducts foreign affairs and receives the credentials of ambassadors , the premier handles domestic policy and the NDC chairman commands the armed forces . In practice , however , the real power is vested in the NDC chairman ( who has also been leader of the WPK ) , an office constitutionally defined as the `` highest post in the state . '' 
Kim Jong-il ( , [ kim.dzʌŋ.il ] or [ kim ] [ tsʌŋ.il ] 16 February 1941/1942 -- 17 December 2011 ) was the supreme leader of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , commonly referred to as North Korea , from 1994 to 2011 . By the early 1980s Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of the country and assumed important posts in the party and army organs . He succeeded his father and founder of the DPRK , Kim Il-sung , following the elder Kim 's death in 1994 . Kim Jong-il was the General Secretary of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , Politburo Standing Committee member of WPK , Chairman of the National Defence Commission ( NDC ) of North Korea , and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) , the fourth-largest standing army in the world . Kim 's leadership is thought to have been even more authoritarian than his father 's .   During Kim 's regime , the country suffered from famine , partially due to economic mismanagement , and had a poor human rights record . Kim involved his country in state terrorism and strengthened the role of the military by his Songun , or `` military-first '' , politics . Kim 's rule also saw tentative economic reforms , including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003 .   In April 2009 , North Korea 's constitution was amended to officially refer to him ( and his later successors ) as the `` supreme leader of the DPRK '' . The most common colloquial title given to him during his reign was `` The Dear Leader '' to distinguish him from his father Kim Il-sung , `` The Great Leader '' . Following Kim 's failure to appear at important public events in 2008 , foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died . On 19 December 2011 , the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier , whereupon his third son , Kim Jong-un , was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him . After his death , he was designated as the `` Eternal General Secretary '' of the WPK and the `` Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission '' , in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim dynasty .

Middle-earth is the fictional setting of much of British writer J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium .  The term is equivalent to the term Midgard of Norse mythology , describing the human-inhabited world , i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien 's imagined mythological past .  Tolkien 's most widely read works , The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , take place entirely in Middle-earth , and Middle-earth has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its fictional universe .   Within his stories , Tolkien translated the name `` Middle-earth '' as Endor ( or sometimes Endórë ) and Ennor in the Elvish languages Quenya and Sindarin respectively , sometimes referring only to the continent that the stories take place on , with another southern continent called the Dark Land .   Middle-earth is the north continent of Earth ( Arda ) in an imaginary period of the Earth 's past  ( Tolkien placed the end of the Third Age at about 6,000 years before his own time ) , in the sense of a `` secondary or sub-creational reality '' .

He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 .   Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .   Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design . In The Blind Watchmaker ( 1986 ) , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms . Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer . In The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion . He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools .   Dawkins has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television , radio and Internet appearances , predominantly discussing his books , his atheism , and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual .

Currently one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Mexico , Tijuana maintains global city status . , the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,696,923 .   Tijuana is located on the Gold Coast of Baja California , and is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality . Tijuana covers 70 % of the municipality but contains over 80 % of its population . A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent , the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies . In the early 21st century , Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America . Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca . The city is the most visited border city in the globe ; sharing a border of about 24 km with its sister city San Diego . More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year . This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the busiest land-border crossing in the world .

Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego ; during the 2000s the drug violence had residents moving out of the congested urban core into isolated communities within the municipality and beyond , as evidenced by 2010 Census figures and growth patterns .   Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias . As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , Tijuana 's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure . The city was founded in July 11 , 1889 as urban development began .

Despite positive reviews , some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N ' Roses , criticizing them for a `` disconnection '' between Scott Weiland and the rest of the band . With their single `` Slither '' , they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance .   The band released Libertad in 2007 , driven by the release of the single `` She Builds Quick Machines '' , and embarked on a tour with Alice in Chains . In April 2008 , Weiland left Velvet Revolver and reunited with Stone Temple Pilots . Velvet Revolver was put on indefinite hiatus in April 2008 . Then , in November of the same year , the band was released by their record label RCA Records , at their request , to allow them `` complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish '' replacing Weiland .   The release of Slash 's self-titled debut solo album and Duff McKagan 's addition to the Jane 's Addiction lineup seemed to put the future of the band in doubt . However , McKagan left Jane 's Addiction a few months after joining . Velvet Revolver then wrote new songs and briefly auditioned singers before once again resuming their hiatus , although reunited with Scott Weiland for a one-off reunion show on January 12 , 2012 at a benefit concert , which proved to be their last performance together before Weiland 's death in 2015 . Slash and McKagan have since rejoined Guns N ' Roses .

He is best known for his twelve-year tenure as the bass guitarist of the hard rock band Guns N ' Roses , with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s . McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 , following their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   Towards the end of his first tenure with Guns N ' Roses , McKagan released a solo album , Believe in Me ( 1993 ) , and formed the short-lived supergroup Neurotic Outsiders . Following his departure from Guns N ' Roses in 1997 , McKagan briefly reunited with his pre-success Seattle punk band 10 Minute Warning , before forming the still-active hard rock band Loaded , in which he performs lead vocals and rhythm guitar . Between 2002 and 2008 , he played bass in the supergroup Velvet Revolver with his former Guns N ' Roses bandmates Slash and Matt Sorum . He briefly performed with Jane 's Addiction in 2010 and joined the supergroup Hollywood Vampires in 2016 .   In addition to his musical career , McKagan has established himself as a writer .

The Quran ( [ kɔrˈɑːn ] ; القرآن , literally meaning `` the recitation '' ; also romanized Qur ` an or Koran ) is the central religious text of Islam , which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God ( Allah ) . It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir . ",0,0.35,3,3,11,135,794

Greek ( Modern Greek : ελληνικά [ eliniˈka ] , elliniká , `` Greek '' , ελληνική γλώσσα [ eliniˈci ˈɣlosa ] , ellinikí glóssa , `` Greek language '' ) is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages , native to Greece and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean . It has the longest documented history of any living language , spanning 34 centuries of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic and many other writing systems .   The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koiné Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , the Greek language is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , Turkey , and the Greek diaspora .   Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary . ",1,0.8600000000000001,4,14,86,79,473

He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 .   Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .   Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design . In The Blind Watchmaker ( 1986 ) , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms . Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer . In The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion . He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools .

His government is the fourth longest one in the history of Italy as a republic . Renzi served as President of the Province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and as Mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014 .   At the age of 39 years and 42 days upon assuming office , Renzi is the youngest person to serve as Italian Prime Minister ( 52 days younger than Benito Mussolini , who took office in 1922 ) and was the youngest leader in the G7 . He was also the first serving Mayor to become Prime Minister . Renzi was sometimes described as the de facto leader of the Party of European Socialists , in opposition to the European People 's Party associated with Angela Merkel ; the two leaders are together often referred to as Merkenzi . In 2014 the American magazine Fortune ranked Renzi as the third most influential person under 40 in the world ; and Foreign Policy listed him as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers . Moreover , Renzi is nicknamed il Rottamatore ( the Scrapper ) due to his ambition of renovating the Italian political establishment .   While in power Renzi 's Government implemented numerous reforms , including changes to the electoral system , a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth , a thorough reformation of the public administration , the simplification of civil trials , the introduction of same-sex civil unions , and the abolition of many small taxes . 
A constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016 . Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy , as well as the division of powers between the State , the regions , and administrative entities .   The bill , put forward by then - Prime Minister of Italy , Matteo Renzi , and his centre-left Democratic Party , was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014 . After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 ( Senate ) and 11 January 2016 ( Chamber ) , and , eventually , its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 ( Senate ) and 12 April 2016 ( Chamber ) .   In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution , a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote . 59.11 % of voters voted against the constitutional reform , meaning it did not come into effect . This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic ; the other two were in 2001 ( in which the amending law was approved ) and in 2006 ( in which it was rejected ) .   Had the voters approved the constitutional law , it would have achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy since the end of the monarchy , not only influencing the organization of the Parliament , but also improving , according to its proponents , on the poor government stability of the country . Opposition parties harshly criticised the bill , claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful .   Following the clear victory of the `` No '' vote , Renzi tendered his resignation as Prime Minister . Paolo Gentiloni was selected as his replacement on December 11 .

Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge , Massachusetts , established in 1636 , whose history , influence , and wealth have made it one of the world 's most prestigious universities .   Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard ( its first benefactor ) , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning , and the Harvard Corporation ( formally , the President and Fellows of Harvard College ) is its first chartered corporation . Although never formally affiliated with any denomination , the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869 -- 1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war . The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College .   The university is organized into eleven separate academic units -- ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study -- with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area : its 209 acre main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 mi northwest of Boston ; the business school and athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area . Harvard 's $ 34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution .   Harvard is a large , highly residential research university . The nominal cost of attendance is high , but the university 's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages . It operates several arts , cultural , and scientific museums , alongside the Harvard Library , which is the world 's largest academic and private library system , comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes .  Harvard 's alumni include eight U.S. presidents , several foreign heads of state , 62 living billionaires , 359 Rhodes Scholars , and 242 Marshall Scholars . To date , some 130 Nobel laureates , 18 Fields Medalists , and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students , faculty , or staff . ",1,0.56,3,9,74,69,544

David Mordechai Packouz ( [ pækhaʊs ] born February 16 , 1982 ) is an American former arms dealer , musician , inventor and entrepreneur .   In 2005 , Packouz ( 23 years old at the time ) joined Efraim Diveroli ( 19 years old at the time ) in Diveroli 's arms company AEY Inc. . By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million . In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions . The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition . Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller . Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .   Packouz went on to invent a guitar pedal drum machine , the BeatBuddy , and is currently the CEO of music technology company Singular Sound . ",1,0.72,3,9,51,48,213

Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , ( ; 13 October 1925 -- 8 April 2013 ) was a British stateswoman , who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and as Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher ( of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire ) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist .

Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area , which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016 .   The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948 . The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products . Market town privileges were granted in 1441 , but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars . In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction . As the industrial revolution took hold , the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century .   Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade , services and industry in Jutland . The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the European Union , and as number 234 among world cities . It is also a top 100 conference city in the world .

With an estimated population of around 15.8 million , it is the most populated state in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción , also known as Guatemala City .   The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved in 1841 .   From the mid to late 19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship .   From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability . As of 2014 , Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the Human Development Index .

Homo sapiens ( Latin : `` wise man '' ) is the binomial nomenclature ( also known as the scientific name ) for the only extant human species . Homo is the human genus , which also includes Neanderthals and many other extinct species of hominin ; H. sapiens is the only surviving species of the genus Homo . Modern humans are the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens , which differentiates them from what has been argued to be their direct ancestor , Homo sapiens idaltu . The ingenuity and adaptability of Homo sapiens has led to it becoming the most influential species on Earth ; it is currently deemed of least concern on the Red List of endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . 
Earth ( from Eorðe [ Γαῖα , Gaia ] Terra ) , otherwise known as the World or the Globe , is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life . It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets .   According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence , Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago . Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , Earth 's only natural satellite . During one orbit around the Sun , Earth rotates about its axis over 365 times ; thus , an Earth year is about 365.26 days long . Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface . The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides , stabilizes the Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation .   Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years . About 71 % of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by its oceans . The remaining 29 % is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes , rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack . Earth 's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the Earth 's magnetic field , and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics .   Within the first billion years of Earth 's history , life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth 's atmosphere and surface , leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms . Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago . Since then , the combination of Earth 's distance from the Sun , physical properties , and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive . In the history of the Earth , biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion , occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events . Over 99 % of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct . Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely ; most species have not been described . Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival . Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures ; politically , the world has about 200 sovereign states . ",1,1.07,8,32,82,152,1288

Mary of Teck ( Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes ; 26 May 1867 -- 24 March 1953 ) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V.   Although technically a princess of Teck , in the Kingdom of Württemberg , she was born and raised in England . Her parents were Francis , Duke of Teck , who was of German extraction , and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , a granddaughter of King George III . She was informally known as `` May '' , after her birth month . At the age of 24 , she was betrothed to Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , the eldest son of the Prince of Wales , but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement , he died unexpectedly of pneumonia . The following year , she became engaged to Albert Victor 's next surviving brother , George , who subsequently became king . Before her husband 's accession , she was successively Duchess of York , Duchess of Cornwall , and Princess of Wales .   As queen consort from 1910 , she supported her husband through World War I , his ill health and major political changes arising from the aftermath of the war , and the rise of socialism and nationalism .

Speech recognition ( SR ) is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers . It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems . These speech industry players include Google , Microsoft , IBM , Baidu , Apple , Amazon , Nuance , SoundHound , IflyTek , CDAC many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning .

The history of Earth concerns the development of the planet Earth from its formation to the present day . Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of the Earth 's past . The age of Earth is approximately one-third of the age of the universe . An immense amount of geological change has occurred in that timespan , accompanied by the emergence of life and its subsequent evolution .   Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula . Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean ; but the atmosphere contained almost no oxygen and so would have been toxic to most modern life including humans . Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism . A giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia while Earth was in its earliest stage , also known as Early Earth , is thought to have been responsible for forming the Moon . Over time , the Earth cooled , causing the formation of a solid crust , and allowing liquid water to exist on the surface .   The geological time scale ( GTS ) clock ( see graphic ) depicts the larger spans of time from the beginning of the Earth as well as a chronology of some definitive events of Earth history . The Hadean Eon represents time before the reliable ( fossil ) record of life beginning on Earth ; it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 billion years ago as defined by international convention . The Archean and Proterozoic eons follow ; they produced the abiogenesis of life on Earth and then the evolution of early life . The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic , which is represented by its three component eras : the Palaeozoic ; the Mesozoic , which spanned the rise , reign , and climactic extinction of the huge dinosaurs ; and the Cenozoic , which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on Earth .   Hominins , the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade , rose sometime during the latter part of the Miocene epoch ; the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 mya . The succeeding Quaternary period is the time of recognizable humans , i.e. , the genus Homo , but that period 's two million-year-plus term of the recent times is too small to be visible at the scale of the GTS graphic . ( Notes re the graphic : Ga means `` billion years '' ; Ma , `` million years '' . )   The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland as well as `` remains of biotic life '' found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , `` If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . ''   Living forms derived from photosynthesis appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today ; and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described .   Geological change has been a constant of Earth 's crust since the time of its formation , and biological change since the first appearance of life . Species continue to evolve , taking on new forms , splitting into daughter species or going extinct in the process of adapting or dying in response to ever-changing physical environments . The process of plate tectonics continues to play a dominant role in the shaping of Earth 's oceans and continents and the living species they harbor . Changes in the biosphere -- now dominated by human activity -- continue , in turn , to produce significant effects on the atmosphere and other systems of the Earth 's surface , such as the integrity of the ozone layer , the proliferation of greenhouse gases , the conditions of productive soils and clean air and water , and others .

Dancehall ( also known as `` Bashment '' ) is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s . Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style , which had dominated much of the 1970s . In the mid-1980s , digital instrumentation became more prevalent , changing the sound considerably , with digital dancehall ( or `` ragga '' ) becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms . Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of Jamaican Patois rather than Jamaican standard English and a focus on the track instrumentals ( or `` riddims '' ) .   Dancehall music saw mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s .

The Mỹ Lai Massacre ( thảm sát Mỹ Lai , [ tʰâːm ʂǎːt mǐˀ lāːj ] ; [ ˌmiːˈlaɪ ] , [ ˌmiːˈleɪ ] , or [ ˌmaɪˈlaɪ ] ) was the Vietnam War mass killing of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam on March 16 , 1968 . It was committed by U.S. Army soldiers from Company C , 1st Battalion , 20th Infantry Regiment , 11th Brigade , 23rd ( Americal ) Infantry Division . Victims included men , women , children , and infants . Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies mutilated . Twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offenses , but only Lieutenant William Calley Jr. , a platoon leader in C Company , was convicted . Found guilty of killing 22 villagers , he was originally given a life sentence , but served only three and a half years under house arrest .   The massacre , which was later called `` the most shocking episode of the Vietnam War '' , took place in two hamlets of Sơn Mỹ village in Quảng Ngãi Province . These hamlets were marked on the U.S. Army topographic maps as My Lai and My Khe . The U.S. Army slang name for the hamlets and sub-hamlets in that area was Pinkville , and the carnage was initially referred to as the Pinkville Massacre . Later , when the U.S. Army started its investigation , the media changed it to the Massacre at Songmy . Currently , the event is referred to as the My Lai Massacre in the United States and called the Sơn Mỹ Massacre in Vietnam .   The incident prompted global outrage when it became public knowledge in November 1969 . The My Lai massacre increased to some extent domestic opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War when the scope of killing and cover-up attempts were exposed . Initially , three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned , and even denounced as traitors by several U.S. Congressmen , including Mendel Rivers , Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee . Only after thirty years were they recognized and decorated , one posthumously , by the U.S. Army for shielding non-combatants from harm in a war zone . Along with the No Gun Ri massacre in Korea eighteen years earlier , My Lai was one of the largest single massacres of civilians by U.S. forces in the 20th century . 
Ernest Lou Medina ( born August 27 , 1936 ) is a former captain of infantry in the United States Army . He served during the Vietnam War and was acquitted in a court-martial of war crimes charges in 1971 .

James VI and I ( 19 June 1566 -- 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch . ",1,1.31,6,49,197,150,1988

West Virginia is the 9th smallest by area , is ranked 38th in population , and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States . The capital and largest city is Charleston .   West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861 , in which delegates from some Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia during the American Civil War , although they included many secessionist counties in the new state . West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key Civil War border state . West Virginia was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states formed during the American Civil War ( the other being Nevada ) .   The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the Southern United States . The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio , with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and Weirton just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , while Bluefield is less than 70 mi from North Carolina . Huntington in the southwest is close to the states of Ohio and Kentucky , while Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry in the Eastern Panhandle region are considered part of the Washington metropolitan area , in between the states of Maryland and Virginia . The unique position of West Virginia means that it is often included in several geographical regions , including the Mid-Atlantic , the Upland South , and the Southeastern United States . It is the only state that is entirely within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission ; the area is commonly defined as `` Appalachia '' .   The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills , its historically significant logging and coal mining industries , and its political and labor history . It is one of the most densely karstic areas in the world , making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research . The karst lands contribute to much of the state 's cool trout waters .

The term `` microbiologist '' comes from the Greek mīkros meaning `` small '' βίος , and bios , meaning `` life '' - λογία , combined with - logia meaning one who studies . A microbiologist ( from Greek μῑκρος ) is a biological scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes or works in the field of microbiology . Microbiologists investigate the growth , interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria , algae , fungi , and some types of parasites and their vectors . They contribute much to the field by trying to understand and learn about the interaction between these microbes and the environment and also among themselves and other organisms . Most microbiologists are qualified to work in offices and/or research facilities , such as a laboratory as well as in the academia . There , they conduct experiments that help them analyze microbes and their importance . A microbiologist 's work is often repeated or improved in order to establish accurate research . Most microbiologists specialize in environmental , food , agricultural , industrial or medical aspects of microbiology including : virology ( the study of viruses ) ; immunology ( the study of mechanisms that fight infections ) ; bioinformatics ( the methods for storing , retrieving , organizing and analyzing biological data ) and Bioremediation ( using microbes as environmental mitigation strategies ) . Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance the understanding of cell reproduction and human disease . Some microbiologists have contributed to knowledge of pathogens and disease-causing microbes . While others , study their interaction with the environment and their use as potential environmental pollution cleaners .   Microbiology is a specific subset of science that often overlaps with other subjects surrounding biology . Because microbiologists specialize in the investigation of microorganisms that typically cause infection , their research commonly promotes information found in immunology , pathology , and molecular biology . Nonetheless , the spectrum of fields a microbiologists can work on is immense .   There were 16,900 microbiologists employed in the United States in 2008 ; this number was projected to increase by over 12 percent in the next decade . ",1,1.7000000000000002,6,39,134,79,332

The genre first became recognizable starting in Britain in 1871 with The Battle of Dorking , a fictional account of an invasion of England by Germany . This short story was so popular it started a literary craze for tales that aroused imaginations and anxieties about hypothetical invasions by foreign powers , and by 1914 the genre had amassed a corpus of over 400 books , many best-sellers , and a world-wide audience . The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics , national policies and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War , and remains a part of popular culture to this day .

The Polynesian languages are a language family spoken in geographical Polynesia and on a patchwork of outliers from south central Micronesia to small islands off the northeast of the larger islands of the southeast Solomon Islands and sprinkled through Vanuatu . They are classified as part of the Austronesian family , belonging to the Oceanic branch of that family . Polynesians share many unique cultural traits that resulted from about 1000 years of common development , including common linguistic development , in the Tonga and Sāmoa area through most of the first millennium BC .   There are approximately forty Polynesian languages . The most prominent of these are Tahitian , Sāmoan , Tongan , Māori and Hawaiian . Because the Polynesian islands were settled relatively recently and because internal linguistic diversification only began around 2,000 years ago , their languages retain strong commonalities . There are still many cognate words across the different islands e.g. tapu , ariki , motu , kava ( Kava culture ) , and tapa as well as Hawaiki , the mythical homeland for some of the cultures .   All Polynesian languages show strong similarity , particularly in vocabulary . The vowels are often stable in the descendant languages , nearly always a , e , i , o and u . The legendary homeland of the Māori of New Zealand , where w is used instead of v , is called Hawaiki ; in the Cook Islands , where h is replaced with the glottal stop , it is ` Avaiki ; in the Hawaiian Islands , where w is used and k is replaced with the glottal stop , the largest island of the group is named Hawai`i ; in Sāmoa , where s has not been replaced by h , v is used instead of w , and k is replaced with the glottal stop , the largest island is called Savai'i . In the Society Islands , k and ng are replaced by the glottal stop , so the name for the ancestral homeland is pronounced Havai`i . ",1,1.6100000000000003,6,22,99,21,303

A monster is any creature , usually found in legends or horror fiction , that is often hideous and may produce fear or physical harm by its appearance or its actions . The word `` monster '' derives from Latin monstrum , meaning an aberrant occurrence , usually biological , that was taken as a sign that something was wrong within the natural order .   The word usually connotes something wrong or evil ; a monster is generally morally objectionable , physically or psychologically hideous , or a freak of nature . It can also be applied figuratively to a person with similar characteristics like a greedy person or a person who does horrible things .   The root of monstrum is monere -- which does not only mean to warn but also to instruct , and forms the basis of the modern English demonstrate . Thus , the monster is also a sign or instruction . This benign interpretation was proposed by Saint Augustine , who did not see the monster as inherently evil , but as part of the natural design of the world , a kind-of deliberate category error .   Well known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula , Frankenstein 's monster , werewolves , mummies , and zombies , to name a few . ",1,0.42,3,8,51,86,386

Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .

Chile , is a South American country occupying a long , narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west . It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández , Salas y Gómez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica , although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty .   The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .   Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing . The regime , headed by Augusto Pinochet , ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010 .   Chile is today one of South America 's most stable and prosperous nations .

Michigan [ ˈmɪʃᵻgən ] is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States . The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa , meaning `` large water '' or `` large lake '' . Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States , with the 11th most extensive total area ( the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River ) . I.e. , including water that is part of state territory . Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest . Its capital is Lansing , and its largest city is Detroit .   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas . The Lower Peninsula , to which the name Michigan was originally applied , is often noted to be shaped like a mitten . The Upper Peninsula ( often referred to as `` the U.P. '' ) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac , a 5 mi channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge . The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world , being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes , plus Lake Saint Clair . As a result , it is one of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating . Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds . A person in the state is never more than 6 mi from a natural water source or more than 85 mi from a Great Lakes shoreline .   What is now the state of Michigan was first settled by Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France . After France 's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule , and was ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800 , when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory . Eventually , in 1805 , the Michigan Territory was formed , which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26 , 1837 , as the 26th state . The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination .   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy , it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , being home to the country 's three major automobile companies ( whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area ) . While sparsely populated , the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources , while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , services , and high-tech industry .

The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals , which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system . Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation − where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment . ",1,0.49,5,47,142,167,870

Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was # 45.5 billion ( # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness . 
The South Wales Coalfield ( Welsh : Maes glo De Cymru ) is a large region of south Wales that is rich in coal deposits , especially the South Wales Valleys . It supported a large part , but not all , of the coal industry in Wales . ",1,1.65,6,85,322,143,1172

Randy Mario Poffo ( November 15 , 1952 -- May 20 , 2011 ) , better known by the ring name `` Macho Man '' Randy Savage , was an American professional wrestler and color commentator best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , now WWE ) and later World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) .   Savage is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers in history ; a number of peers have ranked Savage among the industry 's top performers of all time . He was recognizable by wrestling fans for his distinctively deep and raspy voice , his flamboyant ring attire , intensity exhibited in and out of the ring , using `` Pomp and Circumstance '' as his entrance music , and his signature catch phrase , `` Oooh yeah ! '' . For most of his tenures in the WWF and WCW , Savage was managed by his real-life wife `` Miss Elizabeth '' Hulette .   He won 29 titles during a 32-year career , including the WWF World Heavyweight Championship twice and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship four times . A one-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion , Savage was named by WWE as the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time and was credited for bringing `` a higher level of credibility to the title through his amazing in-ring performances '' .

Professional wrestling ( often shortened pro wrestling , wrestling ) is a form of performance art which combines athletics with theatrical performance.Roland Barthes , `` The World of Wrestling '' , Mythologies , 1957 It takes the form of events , held by touring companies , which mimic a title match combat sport . The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on classical and `` catch '' wrestling , with modern additions of striking attacks , strength-based holds and throws , and acrobatic maneuvers ; much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts . An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included to varying degrees .   The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value , and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury . These facts were once kept highly secretive but are now a widely accepted open secret . By and large , the true nature of the performance is not discussed by the performing company in official media to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude . Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media ( i.e. interviews ) will often directly acknowledge the dramatic and `` fixed '' nature of the spectacle .

James VI and I ( 19 June 1566 -- 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch . ",1,1.99,8,51,215,39,222

Tijuana ( [ tiːˈwɑːnə ] ; [ tiˈxwana ] ) is the largest city in Baja California and on the Baja California Peninsula and center of the Tijuana metropolitan area , part of the international San Diego -- Tijuana metropolitan area . As an industrial and financial center of Mexico , Tijuana exerts a strong influence on economics , education , culture , art , and politics . As the city has become a leading center in the country , so has the surrounding metropolitan area , a major industrial and paramount metropolis in northwestern Mexico . Currently one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Mexico , Tijuana maintains global city status . , the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,696,923 .   Tijuana is located on the Gold Coast of Baja California , and is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality . Tijuana covers 70 % of the municipality but contains over 80 % of its population . A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent , the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies . In the early 21st century , Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America . Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca . The city is the most visited border city in the globe ; sharing a border of about 24 km with its sister city San Diego . More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year . This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the busiest land-border crossing in the world . It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone .   Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico . According to the 2010 census , the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico , with a population of 1,784,034 , but rankings vary , the city ( locality ) itself was 6th largest and the municipality ( administrative ) 3rd largest nationally . The international metropolitan region was estimated to be just over five million in 2009 and about 5,105,769 in 2010 , making it the third largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region , 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas , and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico . Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego ; during the 2000s the drug violence had residents moving out of the congested urban core into isolated communities within the municipality and beyond , as evidenced by 2010 Census figures and growth patterns .   Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias . As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , Tijuana 's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure . The city was founded in July 11 , 1889 as urban development began . Often known by its initials , T.J. , and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico , the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s . ",1,0.8400000000000001,6,10,67,52,437

A viral disease ( or viral infection ) occurs when an organism 's body is invaded by pathogenic viruses , and infectious virus particles ( virions )  attach to and enter susceptible cells . 
Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months ; however , this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system .   Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . More than 99 % of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5 % of cases are from dogs . Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies . The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves . The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms .   Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world . Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk . The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common . In people who have been exposed to rabies , the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms . Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water , povidone iodine , or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission . Only five people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms , and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol .   Rabies caused about 17,400 deaths worldwide in 2015 . More than 95 % of human deaths caused by rabies occur in Africa and Asia . About 40 % of deaths occur in children under the age of 15 . Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica . More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs . A number of countries , including Australia and Japan , as well as much of Western Europe , do not have rabies among dogs . Many small island nations do not have rabies at all . It is classified as a neglected tropical disease . ",1,0.28,2,4,12,66,523

The polar bear ( ursus #Latin maritimus #Latin ) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle , encompassing the Arctic Ocean , its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses . It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ( Ursus arctos middendorffi ) . A boar ( adult male ) weighs around 350 -- , while a sow ( adult female ) is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals ; an alternative basis for classification as marine mammals is that they depend on the ocean as their main food source .   Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change , the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species , and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline . For decades , large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species , but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect . For thousands of years , the polar bear has been a key figure in the material , spiritual , and cultural life of circumpolar peoples , and polar bears remain important in their cultures .

The limbic system is a set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus , immediately beneath the cerebrum . It has also been referred to as the paleomammalian cortex . It is not a separate system but a collection of structures from the telencephalon , diencephalon , and mesencephalon . It includes the olfactory bulbs , hippocampus , hypothalamus , amygdala , anterior thalamic nuclei , fornix , columns of fornix , mammillary body , septum pellucidum , habenular commissure , cingulate gyrus , parahippocampal gyrus , limbic cortex , and limbic midbrain areas .   The limbic system supports a variety of functions including emotion , behavior , motivation , long-term memory , and olfaction . Emotional life is largely housed in the limbic system , and it has a great deal to do with the formation of memories .   Although the term only originated in the 1940s , some neuroscientists , including Joseph LeDoux , have suggested that the concept of a functionally unified limbic system should be abandoned as obsolete because it is grounded mainly in historical concepts of brain anatomy that are no longer accepted as accurate . 
The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system . The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , there are also cortical areas associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , a motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with a particular side of the brain , such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts known as commisures , the largest being the corpus callosum .   The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts known as peduncles . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system of the brain , which consists of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .   The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets . These connections form various neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry of the brain is driven by the process of neurotransmission .   The brain is protected by the skull , suspended in cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood -- brain barrier . However , the brain is still susceptible to damage , disease , and infection . Damage can be caused by trauma , or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke . The brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , forms of dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , and multiple sclerosis . A number of psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia and clinical depression , are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions , although the nature of these is not well understood . The brain can also be the site of tumours , both benign and malignant . Malignant tumours mostly originate from sites outside the brain .   The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy , while the study of its function is neuroscience . A number of different techniques are used to study the brain . Brain specimens from other animals , which may be examined microscopically , have been a traditional source of much information . Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography ( EEG ) recordings are important techniques in studying the brain . Examining the medical history of people with brain injury has also provided great insight into the function of each part of the brain . ",1,0.9300000000000002,5,18,72,142,1000

Matteo Renzi ( [ matˈtɛːo ˈrɛntsi ] ; born 11 January 1975 ) is an Italian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from February 2014 until December 2016 . After the rejection of his constitutional reform in December 2016 referendum , Renzi formally resigned on 12 December , when Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new head of the government by President Sergio Mattarella . His government is the fourth longest one in the history of Italy as a republic . Renzi served as President of the Province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and as Mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014 .   At the age of 39 years and 42 days upon assuming office , Renzi is the youngest person to serve as Italian Prime Minister ( 52 days younger than Benito Mussolini , who took office in 1922 ) and was the youngest leader in the G7 . He was also the first serving Mayor to become Prime Minister . Renzi was sometimes described as the de facto leader of the Party of European Socialists , in opposition to the European People 's Party associated with Angela Merkel ; the two leaders are together often referred to as Merkenzi . In 2014 the American magazine Fortune ranked Renzi as the third most influential person under 40 in the world ; and Foreign Policy listed him as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers . Moreover , Renzi is nicknamed il Rottamatore ( the Scrapper ) due to his ambition of renovating the Italian political establishment .   While in power Renzi 's Government implemented numerous reforms , including changes to the electoral system , a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth , a thorough reformation of the public administration , the simplification of civil trials , the introduction of same-sex civil unions , and the abolition of many small taxes . 
A constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016 . Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy , as well as the division of powers between the State , the regions , and administrative entities .   The bill , put forward by then - Prime Minister of Italy , Matteo Renzi , and his centre-left Democratic Party , was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014 . After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 ( Senate ) and 11 January 2016 ( Chamber ) , and , eventually , its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 ( Senate ) and 12 April 2016 ( Chamber ) .   In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution , a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies , since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote . 59.11 % of voters voted against the constitutional reform , meaning it did not come into effect . This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic ; the other two were in 2001 ( in which the amending law was approved ) and in 2006 ( in which it was rejected ) .   Had the voters approved the constitutional law , it would have achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy since the end of the monarchy , not only influencing the organization of the Parliament , but also improving , according to its proponents , on the poor government stability of the country . Opposition parties harshly criticised the bill , claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful .   Following the clear victory of the `` No '' vote , Renzi tendered his resignation as Prime Minister . Paolo Gentiloni was selected as his replacement on December 11 .

Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium ( the lining of the uterus or womb ) . It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body . The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period . Other symptoms include pain with urination or sexual intercourse , or pelvic pain . Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause .   Approximately 40 % of cases are related to obesity . Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure , high blood pressure and diabetes . Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer , taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination , as in most birth control pills , decreases the risk . Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents . Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as `` uterine cancer '' , although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer , uterine sarcoma , and trophoblastic disease . The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma , which accounts for more than 80 % of cases . Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage . A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer . Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for .   The leading treatment option for endometrial cancer is abdominal hysterectomy ( the total removal by surgery of the uterus ) , together with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries on both sides , called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy . In more advanced cases , radiation therapy , chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended . If the disease is diagnosed at an early stage , the outcome is favorable , and the overall five-year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80 % .   In 2012 , endometrial cancers newly occurred in 320,000 women and caused 76,000 deaths . This makes it the third most common cause of death in cancers which only affect women , behind ovarian and cervical cancer . It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries . Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010 . This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity .

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . ",1,0.91,5,54,216,176,2036

Bhagat Singh ( [ pə̀ɡət̪ sɪ́ŋɡ ] -- 23 March 1931 ) was a charismatic Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement .   In December 1928 , Bhagat Singh and an associate , Shivaram Rajguru , fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer , John Saunders , in Lahore , British India , mistaking Saunders , who was still on probation , for the British police superintendent , James Scott , whom they had intended to assassinate . They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai , by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured , and , two weeks after which , died of a heart attack . Saunders was felled by a single shot from Rajguru , a marksman . He was then shot several times by Singh , the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds . Another associate of Singh , Chandra Shekhar Azad , shot dead an Indian police constable , Chanan Singh , who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled .   After escaping , Singh and his associates , using pseudonyms , publicly owned to avenging Lajpat Rai 's death , putting up prepared posters , which , however , they had altered to show Saunders as their intended target . Singh was thereafter on the run for many months , and no convictions resulted at the time . Surfacing again in April 1929 , he and another associate , Batukeshwar Dutt , exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi . They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below , shouted slogans , and then allowed the authorities to arrest them . The arrest , and the resulting publicity , had the effect of bringing to light Singh 's complicity in the John Saunders case . Awaiting trial , Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike , demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners , and ending in Das 's death from starvation in September 1929 . Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931 , aged 23 .   Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death . Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him , `` Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate , for the moment , the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai , and through him of the nation . He became a symbol ; the act was forgotten , the symbol remained , and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab , and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India , resounded with his name . '' In still later years , Singh , an atheist and socialist in life , won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both Communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists . Although many of Singh 's associates , as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries , were also involved in daring acts , and were either executed or died violent deaths , few came to be lionized in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh .

Anne Rice ( born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien ; October 4 , 1941 ) is an American author of gothic fiction , Christian literature , and erotica . She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels , The Vampire Chronicles , revolving around the central character of Lestat . Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations , Interview with the Vampire in 1994 , and Queen of the Damned in 2002 .   Born in New Orleans , Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas , and later to San Francisco . She was raised in an observant Catholic family , but became an agnostic as a young adult . She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976 , while living in California , and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s . In the mid-2000s , following a publicized return to Catholicism , Rice published the novels Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord : The Road to Cana , fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus . Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity , citing disagreement with the Church 's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained `` central to [ her ] life . '' However , she now considers herself a secular humanist .   Rice 's books have sold nearly 100 million copies , placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history . While reaction to her early works was initially mixed , she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s . Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators . She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years , from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60 . She and Stan had two children , Michele , who died of leukemia at age five , and Christopher , who is also an author .

Macedonia ( Република Македонија , tr . Republika Makedonija ) , is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe . It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia , from which it declared independence in 1991 . It became a member of the United Nations in 1993 , but , as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name `` Macedonia '' , was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( sometimes abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia ) , a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union , the Council of Europe and NATO .   A landlocked country , the Republic of Macedonia has borders with Kosovo to the northwest , Serbia to the north , Bulgaria to the east , Greece to the south , and Albania to the west . It constitutes approximately the northwestern third of the larger geographical region of Macedonia , which also comprises the neighbouring parts of northern Greece and smaller portions of southwestern Bulgaria and southeastern Albania . The country 's geography is defined primarily by mountains , valleys , and rivers . The capital and largest city , Skopje , is home to roughly a quarter of the nation 's 2.06 million inhabitants . The majority of the residents are ethnic Macedonians , a South Slavic people . Albanians form a significant minority at around 25 percent , followed by Turks , Romani , Serbs , and others .   Macedonia 's history dates back to antiquity , beginning with the kingdom of Paeonia , a Thracian polity . In the late sixth century BCE the area was incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire , then annexed by the Kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BCE . The Romans conquered the region in the second century BCE and made it part of the much larger province of Macedonia . Macedonia remained part of the Byzantine ( Eastern Roman ) Empire , and was often raided and settled by Slavic peoples beginning in the sixth century CE . Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian and Byzantine empires , it gradually came under Ottoman dominion from the 14th century . Between the late 19th and early 20th century , a distinct Macedonian identity emerged , although following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 , the modern territory of Macedonia came under Serbian rule . In the aftermath of the First World War ( 1914 -- 1918 ) it became incorporated into the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia , which after the Second World War was re-established as a republic ( 1945 ) and which became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963 . Macedonia remained a constituent socialist republic within Yugoslavia until its peaceful secession in 1991 .   Macedonia is a member of the UN and of the Council of Europe . Since 2005 it has also been a candidate for joining the European Union and has applied for NATO membership . Although one of the poorest countries in Europe , Macedonia has made significant progress in developing an open , market based economy . 
The Balkan Peninsula , or the Balkans , is a peninsula and a cultural area in Eastern and Southeastern Europe with various and disputed borders . The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea .

A working animal is an animal , usually domesticated , that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks . They may be close members of the family , such as guide dogs or other assistance dogs , or they may be animals trained to provide tractive force , such as draft horses or logging elephants . The latter types of animals are called draft animals ( draught animals ) or beasts of burden . Most working animals are either service animals or draft animals . They may also be used for milking or herding , jobs that require human training to encourage the animal to cooperate . Some , at the end of their working lives , may also be used for meat or other products such as leather .   The history of working animals may predate agriculture , with dogs used by our hunter-gatherer ancestors . Around the world , millions of animals work in relationship with their owners . Domesticated species are often bred to be suitable for different uses and conditions , especially horses and working dogs . Working animals are usually raised on farms , though some are still captured from the wild , such as dolphins and some Asian elephants .   People have found uses for a wide variety of abilities found in animals and even in industrialized society many animals are still used for work . The strength of horses , elephants and oxen is used in pulling carts and logs . The keen sense of smell of dogs is used to search for drugs and explosives as well helping to find game while hunting and to search for missing or trapped people . Several animals including camels , donkeys , horses and dogs are used for transport , either riding or to pull wagons and sleds . Other animals including dogs and monkeys provide assistance to blind or disabled people .   On rare occasions , wild animals may be not only tamed , but trained to perform work , though often solely for novelty or entertainment purposes , as such animals tend to lack the traits of trustworthiness and mild temper that characterize the true domesticated working animal . Conversely , not all domesticated animals are working animals . For example , while cats may perform work catching mice , it is an instinctive behavior , not one that can be trained by human intervention . Other domesticated animals , such as sheep , or rabbits , may have agricultural uses for meat , hides and wool , but are not suitable for work .

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease and motor neurone disease ( MND ) , is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles . Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common . ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life . The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50 . The average survival from onset to death is two to four years . About 10 % survive longer than 10 years . Most die from respiratory failure . In much of the world , rates of ALS are unknown . In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year .   Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell . In 1869 , the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot , who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking , diagnosed in 1963 and expected to die within two years , became famous . In 2014 , videos of the ice bucket challenge went viral on the World Wide Web and increased public awareness of the condition . ",1,1.35,7,38,132,67,320

Juventus Football Club S.p.A. ( from Latin iuventūs , `` youth '' ; [ juˈvɛntus ] ) , colloquially known as Juve ( [ ˈjuːve ] ) , is a professional Italian association football club based in Turin , Piedmont , founded in 1897 by a group of young Torinese students , among them was their first president Eugenio Canfari and his brother Enrico , author of the company 's historical memory . The club is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section ( 1893 ) , has traditionally worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played its home matches in several grounds , being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Juventus is also the most successful club in Italian football , the one that has the most sporting tradition in the country and one of the most awarded globally having won overall sixty-three official titles on the national and international stage , more than any other club in Italy : a record thirty-three official league titles , a record twelve Coppa Italia titles , a record seven Supercoppa Italiana titles and , with eleven titles in confederation and inter-confederation competitions ( two Intercontinental Cups , two European Champion Clubs ' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup ) it ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won .   Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus initially as a athletics club , it has spent uninterruptedly in the top flight league system ( reformulated as Serie A since 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006 -- 07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family since 1923 to 1943 and since 1947 until the date . The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the ( now-defunct ) Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup ( the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament ) . With its successive triumphs in the Super Cup in 1984 and in the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the club become also the first in the world -- and remains the only one at present -- to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies , an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999 . In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters groups -- often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin -- , it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and abroad , mainly in countries with a significant presence of Italian immigrants , making Juventus a symbol of campanilismo ( `` Anti-parochialism '' ) and italianità ( `` Italianness '' ) along with the club 's tradition of success , some of which have had a significant impact in Italian society , especially in the 1930s and the first post-war decade , as well as the ideological politics and socio-economic origin of the club 's sympathisers and the club 's contribution to the national team -- the most for an Italian club -- , uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football , having performed a decisive role in the Azzurri 's World Cup triumphs of 1934 , 1982 and 2006 .

He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 .   Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .   Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design . In The Blind Watchmaker ( 1986 ) , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms . Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer . In The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion .

After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited . Murdoch thus had full control as Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation , now the world 's second-largest media conglomerate , and its successors , News Corp and 21st Century Fox , after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013 .   In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen ( and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship ) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens .

The Concert for Bangladesh ( or Bangla Desh , as the country was originally spelled ) was the collective name for two benefit concerts organised by former Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison and Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar . The concerts were held at 2:30 and 8:00 pm on Sunday , 1 August 1971 , at Madison Square Garden in New York City . The shows were organised to raise international awareness and fund relief efforts for refugees from East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) , following the Bangladesh Liberation War-related genocide . The concerts were followed by a bestselling live album , a boxed three-record set , and Apple Films ' concert documentary , which opened in cinemas in the spring of 1972 .   The event was the first-ever benefit concert of such a magnitude and featured a supergroup of performers that included Harrison , fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr , Bob Dylan , Eric Clapton , Billy Preston , Leon Russell and the band Badfinger . In addition , Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan -- both of whom had ancestral roots in Bangladesh -- performed an opening set of Indian classical music . Decades later , Shankar would say of the overwhelming success of the event : `` In one day , the whole world knew the name of Bangladesh . It was a fantastic occasion ...

The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals , which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system . Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation − where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment . ",1,0.49,5,23,123,110,780

Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months ; however , this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system .   Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . More than 99 % of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5 % of cases are from dogs . Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies . The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves . The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms .   Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world . Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk . The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common . In people who have been exposed to rabies , the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms . Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water , povidone iodine , or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission . Only five people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms , and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol .   Rabies caused about 17,400 deaths worldwide in 2015 . More than 95 % of human deaths caused by rabies occur in Africa and Asia . About 40 % of deaths occur in children under the age of 15 . Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica . More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs . A number of countries , including Australia and Japan , as well as much of Western Europe , do not have rabies among dogs . Many small island nations do not have rabies at all . It is classified as a neglected tropical disease . ",1,0.56,5,10,73,50,580

Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus initially as a athletics club , it has spent uninterruptedly in the top flight league system ( reformulated as Serie A since 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006 -- 07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family since 1923 to 1943 and since 1947 until the date . The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the ( now-defunct ) Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup ( the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament ) . With its successive triumphs in the Super Cup in 1984 and in the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the club become also the first in the world -- and remains the only one at present -- to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies , an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999 . In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters groups -- often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin -- , it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and abroad , mainly in countries with a significant presence of Italian immigrants , making Juventus a symbol of campanilismo ( `` Anti-parochialism '' ) and italianità ( `` Italianness '' ) along with the club 's tradition of success , some of which have had a significant impact in Italian society , especially in the 1930s and the first post-war decade , as well as the ideological politics and socio-economic origin of the club 's sympathisers and the club 's contribution to the national team -- the most for an Italian club -- , uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football , having performed a decisive role in the Azzurri 's World Cup triumphs of 1934 , 1982 and 2006 .

Henry II ( Henri II 31 March 1519 -- 10 July 1559 ) was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 31 March 1547 until his death in 1559 . The second son of Francis I , he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis III , Duke of Brittany , in 1536 .   As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father . Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion . He persevered in the Italian Wars against the House of Habsburg and tried to suppress the Protestant Reformation , even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign .   The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis ( 1559 ) , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics . France failed to change the balance of power in Europe , as Spain remained the sole dominant power , but it did benefit from the division of the holdings of its ruler , Charles V , and from the weakening of the Holy Roman Empire , which Charles also ruled .   Henry suffered an untimely death in a jousting tournament held to celebrate the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis at the conclusion of the Eighth Italian War .

Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording , Westlake Recording Studios , and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles , California . Jackson collaborated with a number of writers and performers , such as Paul McCartney , Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton . Five singles were released from the album ; three of the singles had music videos released . Jackson wrote three of the songs himself , including the number-one Grammy Award-winning single `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough '' .   The record was a departure from Jackson 's previous work for Motown Records . Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism , liberation , loneliness , hedonism and romance . Several critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk , disco , soft rock , jazz , Broadway and pop ballads . Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record . The record gained critical acclaim and recognition , and won the singer his first Grammy Award . With Off the Wall , Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 . The album was an enormous commercial success ; as of 2014 it is certified eight times platinum in the United States and has reportedly sold more than 20 million copies worldwide , making it one of the best selling albums of all time . On October 16 , 2001 , a special edition reissue of Off the Wall was released by Sony Records . It was re-released on February 26 , 2016 . Recent reviews by AllMusic and Blender have continued to praise Off the Wall for its appeal in the 21st century .

Otto I ( 23 November 912 -- 7 May 973 ) , traditionally known as Otto I the Great ( Otto I. der Große ) , was German king from 936 and emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 962 until his death in 973 . He was the oldest son of Henry I the Fowler and Matilda .   Otto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father 's death in 936 . He continued his father 's work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king 's powers at the expense of the aristocracy . Through strategic marriages and personal appointments , Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom 's most important duchies . This reduced the various dukes , who had previously been co-equals with the king , to royal subjects under his authority . Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen royal authority and subjected its clergy to his personal control .   After putting down a brief civil war among the rebellious duchies , Otto defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 , thus ending the Hungarian invasions of Western Europe . The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto a reputation as a savior of Christendom and secured his hold over the kingdom . By 961 , Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy and extended his realm 's borders to the north , east , and south . The patronage of Otto and his immediate successors facilitated a so-called `` Ottonian Renaissance '' of arts and architecture . Following the example of Charlemagne 's coronation as `` Emperor of the Romans '' in 800 , Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962 by Pope John XII in Rome .   Otto 's later years were marked by conflicts with the papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy . Reigning from Rome , Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire , which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm 's further expansion to the south . To resolve this conflict , the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son Otto II in April 972 . Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in May 973 . Otto II succeeded him as Holy Roman Emperor . ",1,1.0,4,35,116,66,436

The 1979 NBA draft was the 33rd annual draft of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The draft was held on June 25 , 1979 , before the 1979 -- 80 season . In this draft , 22 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players , including international players . The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each conference , with the order determined by a coin flip . The Los Angeles Lakers , who obtained the New Orleans Jazz ' first-round pick in a trade , won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick , while the Chicago Bulls were awarded the second pick . The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win -- loss record in the previous season . A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection . If a player left college early , he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated . Larry Bird would have been eligible to join this draft class because his `` junior eligible '' draft status from being taken by Boston in 1978 would expire the minute the 1979 draft began , but Bird and the Celtics agreed on a 5-year contract in time to avoid that . Before the draft , five college underclassman were declared eligible for selection under the `` hardship '' rule . These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league , which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier . Prior to the draft , the Jazz relocated from New Orleans to Salt Lake City and became the Utah Jazz . The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 202 players . 
Earvin `` Magic '' Johnson Jr. ( born August 14 , 1959 ) is an American retired professional basketball player and current president of basketball operations of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons . After winning championships in high school and college , Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers . He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season , and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s . Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV , but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game , winning the All-Star MVP Award . After protests from his fellow players , he retired again for four years , but returned in 1996 , at age 36 , to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time .   Johnson 's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards , nine NBA Finals appearances , twelve All-Star games , and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations . He led the league in regular-season assists four times , and is the NBA 's all-time leader in average assists per game , at 11.2 . Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men 's Olympic basketball team ( `` The Dream Team '' ) , which won the Olympic gold medal in 1992 . After leaving the NBA in 1992 , Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars , a barnstorming team that travelled around the world playing exhibition games . Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 .   Johnson became a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame -- being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career , and again in 2010 as a member of the `` Dream Team '' . He was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007 . His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird , whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series , are well documented .   Since his retirement , Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex , as well as an entrepreneur , philanthropist , broadcaster and motivational speaker . His public announcement of his HIV-positive status in 1991 helped dispel the stereotype , still widely held at the time , that HIV was a `` gay disease '' that heterosexuals need not worry about ; his bravery in making this announcement was widely commended . Named by Ebony magazine as one of America 's most influential black businessmen in 2009 , Johnson has numerous business interests , and was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years . Johnson also is part of a group of investors that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012 and the Los Angeles Sparks in 2014 . 
The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time . Above all , the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football ( soccer ) . While the guard must understand and accept the coach 's gameplan , he must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing , and he also must control the pace of the game .   A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . A point guard 's primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for his/her team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc. .   Among the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is Magic Johnson , who was 6 ' 9 '' ( 2.06 m ) and won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award three times in his career . Other point guards who have been named NBA MVP include Bob Cousy , Oscar Robertson , Derrick Rose and two-time winners Stephen Curry and Steve Nash . In the NBA , point guards are usually about 6 ' 5 '' ( 1.96 m ) or shorter , and average about 6 ' 2.75 '' ( 1.90 m ) whereas in the WNBA , point guards are usually 5 ' 9 '' ( 1.75 m ) or shorter . Having above-average size ( height , muscle ) is considered advantageous , although size is secondary to situational awareness , speed , quickness , and ball handling skills . Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor , and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling .   After an opponent scores , it is typically the point guard who brings the ball down court to begin an offensive play . Passing skills , ball handling , and court vision are crucial . Speed is important ; a speedy point guard is better able to create separation and space off the dribble , giving him/herself room to work . Point guards are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring . Another major evaluation factor is Assist-to-Turnover ratio , which reflects the decision-making skills of the player . Still , a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective jump shot . ",1,0.7000000000000001,5,13,88,347,3746

The Quran ( [ kɔrˈɑːn ] ; القرآن , literally meaning `` the recitation '' ; also romanized Qur ` an or Koran ) is the central religious text of Islam , which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God ( Allah ) . It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir . ",1,1.28,7,20,95,51,401

The polar bear ( ursus #Latin maritimus #Latin ) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle , encompassing the Arctic Ocean , its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses . It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ( Ursus arctos middendorffi ) . A boar ( adult male ) weighs around 350 -- , while a sow ( adult female ) is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals ; an alternative basis for classification as marine mammals is that they depend on the ocean as their main food source .   Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change , the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species , and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline . For decades , large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species , but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect . For thousands of years , the polar bear has been a key figure in the material , spiritual , and cultural life of circumpolar peoples , and polar bears remain important in their cultures .

The series ' executive producers included Shore , Attanasio , Attanasio 's business partner Katie Jacobs , and film director Bryan Singer . It was filmed largely in Century City .   House often clashes with his fellow physicians , including his own diagnostic team , because many of his hypotheses about patients ' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights .

House 's only true friend is Dr. James Wilson ( Robert Sean Leonard ) , head of the Department of Oncology . During the first three seasons , House 's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase ( Jesse Spencer ) , Dr. Allison Cameron ( Jennifer Morrison ) , and Dr. Eric Foreman ( Omar Epps ) . At the end of the third season , this team disbands . Rejoined by Foreman , House gradually selects three new team members : Dr. Remy `` Thirteen '' Hadley ( Olivia Wilde ) , Dr. Chris Taub ( Peter Jacobson ) , and Dr. Lawrence Kutner ( Kal Penn ) . Kutner makes an appearance late in season five and then reappears in season 8 episode 22 . Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six .

Their newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield .   Founded in 1882 , Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901 , making them the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888 . Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double , winning both competitions in the 1960 -- 61 season . After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962 , in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition -- the European Cup Winners ' Cup . In 1967 , Spurs won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s . In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and were the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972 , becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies . In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies : the FA Cup twice , FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984 . In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup . When they won the League Cup once more in 2008 , it meant that they had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades -- an achievement only matched by Manchester United .   The club 's Latin motto is Audere est Facere ( lit : `` To Dare Is to Do '' ) , and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football . The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby neighbours Arsenal , with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby . 
The EFL Cup , or simply the League Cup , is an annual knockout football competition in men 's domestic English football . Organised by the English Football League ( EFL ) , it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system -- 92 clubs in total -- comprising the top level Premier League , and the three divisions of the English Football League 's own league competition ( Championship , League One and League Two ) .   First held in 1960 -- 61 as the Football League Cup , it is one of the three top domestic football competitions in England , alongside the Premier League and FA Cup . It concludes in February , long before the other two , which end in May . It was introduced by the league as a response to the growing popularity of European football , and to also exert power over the FA . It also took advantage of the roll-out of floodlights , allowing the fixtures to be played as midweek evening games . With the renaming of the Football League as the English Football League in 2016 , the tournament was rebranded as the EFL Cup from the 2016 -- 17 season onwards .   The tournament is played over seven rounds , with single leg ties throughout , except the semi-finals . The final is held at Wembley Stadium ; it is the only tie in the competition played at a neutral venue and on a weekend ( Sunday ) . Entrants are seeded in the early rounds , and a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds , and to defer the entry of teams still involved in Europe . Winners receive the EFL Cup , of which there have been three designs , the current one also being the original . Winners also qualify for European football with a place in the UEFA Europa League -- although this place is transferred to the highest-placed Premier League team not already qualified for European competition , should the winner also qualify for Europe through other means at the end of the season . The current holders are Manchester United , who beat Southampton 3 -- 2 in the 2017 final to win their fifth League Cup . 
The FA Cup is an annual knockout football competition in men 's domestic English football . First played during the 1871 -- 72 season , it is the oldest association football competition in the world . It is organised by and named after The Football Association ( The FA ) . For sponsorship reasons , from 2015 through to 2018 it is also known as The Emirates FA Cup . A concurrent women 's tournament is also held , the FA Women 's Cup .   The competition is open to any eligible club down to Level 10 of the English football league system -- all 92 professional clubs in the Premier League ( Level 1 ) and the English Football League ( Levels 2 to 4 ) , and several hundred `` non-league '' teams in Steps 1 to 6 of the National League System ( Levels 5 to 10 ) . A record 763 clubs competed in 2011 -- 12 . The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final . Entrants are not seeded , although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds -- the minimum number of games needed to win the competition ranges from six to fourteen .   The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition , from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper , meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two . The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs , into the draw for the Third Round Proper . In the modern era , only one non-league team has ever reached the quarter finals , and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.Since 1920 , when the Football League expanded to three divisions , no club from outside the top two divisions has reached the final . Since 1914 , when QPR reached the fourth round proper ( the last eight/quarter-final stage ) , the only non-league club to have reached that stage is Lincoln City in 2017 . As a result , as well as who wins , significant focus is given to those `` minnows '' ( smaller teams ) who progress furthest , especially if they achieve an unlikely `` giant-killing '' victory .   Winners receive the FA Cup trophy , of which there have been two designs and five actual cups ; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design , introduced in 1911 . Winners also qualify for the Europa League and a place in the FA Community Shield match . Arsenal are the current holders , having beaten Chelsea 2 -- 1 in the 2017 final to win the cup for the 13th time in their history and become the tournament 's most successful club . Arsenal 's Arsène Wenger is the most successful manager in the competition , with seven finals won . ",1,0.56,3,15,95,700,9184

Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz ( [ fiˈðel aleˈhandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus ] ; August 13 , 1926 -- November 25 , 2016 ) was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who governed the Republic of Cuba as Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President from 1976 to 2008 . Politically a Marxist -- Leninist and Cuban nationalist , he also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011 . Under his administration , Cuba became a one-party socialist state ; industry and business were nationalized , and state socialist reforms were implemented throughout society .   Born in Birán , Oriente as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer , Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist politics while studying law at the University of Havana . After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia , he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista , launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953 . After a year 's imprisonment , he traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group , the 26th of July Movement , with his brother Raúl Castro and Che Guevara . Returning to Cuba , Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista 's forces from the Sierra Maestra . After Batista 's overthrow in 1959 , Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba 's Prime Minister . The United States came to oppose Castro 's government , and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination , economic blockade , and counter-revolution , including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 . Countering these threats , Castro formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba , sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis -- a defining incident of the Cold War -- in 1962 .   Adopting a Marxist -- Leninist model of development , Castro converted Cuba into a one-party , socialist state under Communist Party rule , the first in the Western Hemisphere . Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent . Abroad , Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups , backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile , Nicaragua , and Grenada , and sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur War , Ogaden War , and Angolan Civil War . These actions , coupled with Castro 's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba 's medical internationalism , increased Cuba 's profile on the world stage . Following the Soviet Union 's dissolution in 1991 , Castro led Cuba into its `` Special Period '' and embraced environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas . In the 2000s he forged alliances in the Latin American `` pink tide '' -- namely with Hugo Chávez 's Venezuela -- and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas . In 2006 he transferred his responsibilities to Vice-President Raúl Castro , who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008 .   Castro is a polarizing world figure . His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba 's independence from American imperialism . Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses , the exodus of a large number of Cubans , and the impoverishment of the country 's economy . He was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world . ",1,1.23,5,34,168,127,897

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . ",1,0.8400000000000001,5,41,173,96,736

Sid Meier 's Civilization IV is a turn-based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the Civilization series . It was designed by Soren Johnson under the direction of Sid Meier and his video game development studio Firaxis Games . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia , between October 25 and November 4 , 2005 .   Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay , in which the player 's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources . Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC . As with other games in the series , there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game : conquering all other civilizations , controlling a supermajority of the game world 's land and population , building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system , increasing the `` Culture ratings '' of at least three different cities to `` legendary '' levels , or winning a `` World Leader '' popularity contest by the United Nations . If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players , the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner . A large departure from earlier Civilization games is a new graphics engine created from scratch , based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited ( NDL ) .   The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre . Civilization IV has sold 3 million copies and won multiple awards , including several Game of the Year awards . In addition to this , Firaxis Games has also released two major expansions , Civilization IV : Warlords and Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword , as well as the standalone game Civilization IV : Colonization , which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled Sid Meier 's Civilization IV : The Complete Edition .

Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore , a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota , United States . Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture 's design and oversaw the project 's execution from 1927-1941 with the help of his son , Lincoln Borglum . Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732 -- 1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743 -- 1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858 -- 1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809 -- 1865 ) . The memorial park covers 1278.45 acre and is 5725 ft above sea level .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on Mount Rushmore , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents .   After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project . Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist . Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and it has appeared in works of fiction , as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million visitors annually . ",1,0.9300000000000002,5,20,75,225,1055

Charles Milles Manson ( born Charles Milles Maddox , November 12 , 1934 ) is an American criminal and former cult leader who led what became known as the Manson Family , a quasi-commune that arose in California in the late 1960s . Manson 's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August of 1969 . In 1971 he was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people ( Abigail Ann Folger , Wojciech Frykowski , Steven Earl Parent , Sharon Tate Polanski , Jay Sebring , and Leno and Rosemary La Bianca ) -- most notably of the actress Sharon Tate -- all of which were carried out by members of the group at his instruction . Manson was originally sentenced to death ; however , his death sentence was converted to life with the possibility of parole when in 1972 , the death penalty in California was ruled unconstitutional . California did not have the life-without-parole sentence at the time . Manson also received first-degree murder convictions for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald `` Shorty '' Shea . He is currently serving a life sentence at California State Prison , Corcoran , in Corcoran , California .   Manson believed in what he called `` Helter Skelter '' , a term he took from the Beatles ' song of the same name . Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war , which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles ' song . He believed the murders would help precipitate that war . From the beginning of his notoriety , a pop culture arose around him in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity , violence and the macabre .   At the time the Family began to form , Manson was an unemployed former convict , who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses . Before the murders , he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry , chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson , drummer and founding member of the Beach Boys . After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted , recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially .

Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz ( [ fiˈðel aleˈhandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus ] ; August 13 , 1926 -- November 25 , 2016 ) was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who governed the Republic of Cuba as Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President from 1976 to 2008 . Politically a Marxist -- Leninist and Cuban nationalist , he also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011 . Under his administration , Cuba became a one-party socialist state ; industry and business were nationalized , and state socialist reforms were implemented throughout society .   Born in Birán , Oriente as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer , Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist politics while studying law at the University of Havana . After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia , he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista , launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953 . After a year 's imprisonment , he traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group , the 26th of July Movement , with his brother Raúl Castro and Che Guevara . Returning to Cuba , Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista 's forces from the Sierra Maestra . After Batista 's overthrow in 1959 , Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba 's Prime Minister . The United States came to oppose Castro 's government , and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination , economic blockade , and counter-revolution , including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 . Countering these threats , Castro formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba , sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis -- a defining incident of the Cold War -- in 1962 .   Adopting a Marxist -- Leninist model of development , Castro converted Cuba into a one-party , socialist state under Communist Party rule , the first in the Western Hemisphere . Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent . Abroad , Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups , backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile , Nicaragua , and Grenada , and sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur War , Ogaden War , and Angolan Civil War . These actions , coupled with Castro 's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba 's medical internationalism , increased Cuba 's profile on the world stage . Following the Soviet Union 's dissolution in 1991 , Castro led Cuba into its `` Special Period '' and embraced environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas . In the 2000s he forged alliances in the Latin American `` pink tide '' -- namely with Hugo Chávez 's Venezuela -- and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas . In 2006 he transferred his responsibilities to Vice-President Raúl Castro , who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008 .   Castro is a polarizing world figure . His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba 's independence from American imperialism . Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses , the exodus of a large number of Cubans , and the impoverishment of the country 's economy . He was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world . ",1,0.72,3,13,37,72,568

Quasimodo ( from Quasimodo Sunday ) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame ( 1831 ) by Victor Hugo . Quasimodo was born with a hunchback and feared by the townspeople as a sort of monster , but he finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death . The role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film and stage adaptations , including Lon Chaney , Sr. ( 1923 ) and Charles Laughton ( 1939 ) , as well as Tom Hulce in the 1996 Disney animated adaptation . In 2010 , a British researcher found evidence suggesting there was a real-life hunchbacked stone carver who worked at Notre Dame during the same period Victor Hugo was writing the novel and they may have even known each other . 
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1923 American romantic drama film with horror elements starring Lon Chaney , directed by Wallace Worsley , and produced by Carl Laemmle and Irving Thalberg . The supporting cast includes Patsy Ruth Miller , Norman Kerry , Nigel de Brulier , and Brandon Hurst . The film was Universal 's `` Super Jewel '' of 1923 and was their most successful silent film , grossing over $ 3 million .   The film is based on Victor Hugo 's 1831 novel of the same name , and is notable for the grand sets that recall 15th century Paris as well as for Chaney 's performance and make-up as the tortured hunchback Quasimodo . The film elevated Chaney , already a well-known character actor , to full star status in Hollywood , and also helped set a standard for many later horror films , including Chaney 's The Phantom of the Opera in 1925 . In 1951 , the film entered the public domain ( in the USA ) due to the claimants failure to renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication .

The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus . It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior .   Horses ' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .   Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament : spirited `` hot bloods '' with speed and endurance ; `` cold bloods '' , such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow , heavy work ; and `` warmbloods '' , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods , often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes , particularly in Europe . There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today , developed for many different uses .   Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits , as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment , and therapy . Horses were historically used in warfare , from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed , using many different styles of equipment and methods of control . Many products are derived from horses , including meat , milk , hide , hair , bone , and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . Humans provide domesticated horses with food , water and shelter , as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers . ",1,1.14,4,39,150,34,289
1329,The French Resistance committed acts of sabotage on electric power grids.,"[['The Résistance also planned , coordinated , and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid , transport facilities , and telecommunications networks .', 'French_Resistance', 6, []]]","
The French Resistance ( La Résistance ) was the collection of French resistance movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy régime during the Second World War . Résistance cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the Maquis in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first-hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines . The men and women of the Résistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society , including émigrés ; academics , students , aristocrats , conservative Roman Catholics ( including priests ) and also citizens from the ranks of liberals , anarchists and communists .   The French Resistance played a significant role in facilitating , through means of giving supplies , and vital information , the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 , and the lesser-known invasion of Provence on 15 August , by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle . The Résistance also planned , coordinated , and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid , transport facilities , and telecommunications networks . It was also politically and morally important to France , both during the German occupation and for decades afterward , because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative , countering an existential threat to French nationhood . The actions of the Résistance stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy , the French people who joined the pro-Nazi Milice française and the French men who joined the Waffen SS .   After the landings in Normandy and Provence , the paramilitary components of the Résistance were organised more formally , into a hierarchy of operational units known , collectively , as the French Forces of the Interior ( FFI ) . Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944 , the FFI grew rapidly and reached approximately 400,000 by October of that year . Although the amalgamation of the FFI was , in some cases , fraught with political difficulties , it was ultimately successful , and it allowed France to rebuild the fourth-largest army in the European theatre ( 1.2 million men ) by VE Day in May 1945 .

Kim Jong-il ( , [ kim.dzʌŋ.il ] or [ kim ] [ tsʌŋ.il ] 16 February 1941/1942 -- 17 December 2011 ) was the supreme leader of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , commonly referred to as North Korea , from 1994 to 2011 . By the early 1980s Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of the country and assumed important posts in the party and army organs . He succeeded his father and founder of the DPRK , Kim Il-sung , following the elder Kim 's death in 1994 . Kim Jong-il was the General Secretary of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , Politburo Standing Committee member of WPK , Chairman of the National Defence Commission ( NDC ) of North Korea , and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) , the fourth-largest standing army in the world . Kim 's leadership is thought to have been even more authoritarian than his father 's .   During Kim 's regime , the country suffered from famine , partially due to economic mismanagement , and had a poor human rights record . Kim involved his country in state terrorism and strengthened the role of the military by his Songun , or `` military-first '' , politics . Kim 's rule also saw tentative economic reforms , including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003 .   In April 2009 , North Korea 's constitution was amended to officially refer to him ( and his later successors ) as the `` supreme leader of the DPRK '' . The most common colloquial title given to him during his reign was `` The Dear Leader '' to distinguish him from his father Kim Il-sung , `` The Great Leader '' . Following Kim 's failure to appear at important public events in 2008 , foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died . On 19 December 2011 , the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier , whereupon his third son , Kim Jong-un , was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him . After his death , he was designated as the `` Eternal General Secretary '' of the WPK and the `` Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission '' , in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim dynasty .

Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal ( with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God ) and nu metal ( with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park ) , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976 , with Ho Chi Minh City as a historical city as well .   The northern part of Vietnam was part of Imperial China for over a millennium , from 111 BC to AD 939 . An independent Vietnamese state was formed in 939 , following a Vietnamese victory in the Battle of Bạch Đằng River . Successive Vietnamese imperial dynasties flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia , until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century . Following a Japanese occupation in the 1940s , the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War , eventually expelling the French in 1954 . Thereafter , Vietnam was divided politically into two rival states , North Vietnam ( officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ) , and South Vietnam ( officially the Republic of Vietnam ) . Conflict between the two sides intensified in what is known as the Vietnam War . The war ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975 .   Vietnam was then unified under a communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated . In 1986 , the government initiated a series of economic and political reforms which began Vietnam 's path towards integration into the world economy .

Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .   Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design .

Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer .

Ten is the debut studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam , released on August 27 , 1991 through Epic Records . Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard 's previous group Mother Love Bone , the two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder , guitarist Mike McCready , and drummer Dave Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990 . Most of the songs began as instrumental jams , to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression , homelessness , and abuse .   Ten was not an immediate success , but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart . The album produced three hit singles : `` Alive '' , `` Even Flow '' , and `` Jeremy '' . While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time -- despite the fact that Ten had been both recorded and released before Nirvana 's Nevermind -- Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream . In February 2013 , the album crossed the 10 million mark in sales , becoming the 22nd one to do so in the Nielsen SoundScan era and has been certified 13x platinum by the RIAA . It remains Pearl Jam 's most commercially successful album .

One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s , over the course of the band 's career , its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices , including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews , and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster . In 2006 , Rolling Stone described the band as having `` spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame . ''   To date , the band has sold nearly 32million records in the United States and an estimated 60million worldwide . Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s , and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as `` the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s '' .

Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area , which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016 .   The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948 . The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products . Market town privileges were granted in 1441 , but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars .

Marvel vs. Capcom : Infinite is an upcoming fighting video game in development by Capcom . It is the sixth main entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of crossover games . Like previous installments , players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles . Infinite features two-on-two fights , as opposed to the three-on-three format used in its preceding titles . The series ' traditional character assists have been removed ; instead , the game incorporates a tag-based combo system , which allows players to form continuous combos between their two characters . It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the Infinity Stones , which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected . The game is planned for release in September 2017 for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Microsoft Windows .   Infinite was announced during Sony 's PlayStation Experience event in December 2016 . Capcom initially lost the use of the Marvel license in 2012 , after The Walt Disney Company decided to focus on self-publishing its own gaming titles ; however , Capcom was able to reacquire the license after Disney scrapped their plans . Infinite was designed to be more accessible than previous Marvel vs. Capcom games , resulting in departures from some series ' mainstays , such as assists . The game will also feature a larger emphasis on storytelling , with its own cinematic story experience . The plot follows the heroes and villains of the Marvel and Capcom universes , who must work together to save their merged worlds against a new threat , Ultron Sigma . 
is a series of crossover fighting games developed and published by Capcom , featuring characters from their own video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics . The series originated as coin-operated arcade games , though later releases would be specifically developed for home consoles , handhelds , and personal computers .   Its gameplay borrows heavily from Capcom 's previous Marvel-licensed fighting games X-Men : Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes ; however , instead of focusing on single combat , the games incorporated tag team battles . Players form teams of two or three characters and , controlling one fighter at a time , attempt to damage and knock out their opponents . Players can switch out their characters during the match , allowing team members to replenish their health and prolong their ability to fight . The series ' gameplay is also distinguished from other fighting game franchises due to its character assist mechanics and emphasis on aerial combat .   The Marvel vs. Capcom series has received generally positive reviews from critics , who have praised its fast-paced gameplay , animated visuals , and wealth of playable characters . On the other hand , the games have been criticized for their lack of content , especially more recent installments . The series has enjoyed broad appeal , especially in markets outside of Japan , selling approximately 7 million units as of December 2016 . ",1,0.77,5,15,52,345,2877

Bret Easton Ellis ( born March 7 , 1964 ) is an American author , screenwriter , and short story writer . His works have been translated into 27 languages . He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack , which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney . He is a self-proclaimed satirist , whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style . Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common , recurring characters .   Though Ellis made his debut at age 21 with the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero ( 1985 ) , a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles , the work he is most known for is his third novel , American Psycho ( 1991 ) . On its release , the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic . Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year . In later years , Ellis ' novels have become increasingly metafictional . Lunar Park ( 2005 ) , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews . Imperial Bedrooms ( 2010 ) , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein .   Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films . Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen , leading to the release of a starkly different film of the same name in 1987 . Mary Harron 's adaptation of American Psycho was released to generally positive reviews in 2000 and went on to achieve cult status . Roger Avary 's 2002 adaptation The Rules of Attraction made modest box office returns but went on to attract a cult following . 2008 's The Informers , based on Ellis 's collection of short stories , was critically panned . Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film The Canyons , an original work . ",1,1.98,5,15,52,64,246

It can also be applied figuratively to a person with similar characteristics like a greedy person or a person who does horrible things .   The root of monstrum is monere -- which does not only mean to warn but also to instruct , and forms the basis of the modern English demonstrate . Thus , the monster is also a sign or instruction . This benign interpretation was proposed by Saint Augustine , who did not see the monster as inherently evil , but as part of the natural design of the world , a kind-of deliberate category error .   Well known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula , Frankenstein 's monster , werewolves , mummies , and zombies , to name a few . ",1,1.64,3,10,40,86,386

Bret Easton Ellis ( born March 7 , 1964 ) is an American author , screenwriter , and short story writer . His works have been translated into 27 languages . He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack , which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney . He is a self-proclaimed satirist , whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style . Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common , recurring characters .   Though Ellis made his debut at age 21 with the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero ( 1985 ) , a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles , the work he is most known for is his third novel , American Psycho ( 1991 ) . On its release , the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic . Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year . In later years , Ellis ' novels have become increasingly metafictional . Lunar Park ( 2005 ) , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews . Imperial Bedrooms ( 2010 ) , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein .   Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films . Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen , leading to the release of a starkly different film of the same name in 1987 . Mary Harron 's adaptation of American Psycho was released to generally positive reviews in 2000 and went on to achieve cult status . Roger Avary 's 2002 adaptation The Rules of Attraction made modest box office returns but went on to attract a cult following . 2008 's The Informers , based on Ellis 's collection of short stories , was critically panned . Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film The Canyons , an original work . ",1,0.79,3,12,38,137,485

DeLonge grew up in the suburbs of Poway , California , where he embraced skateboarding at an early age . DeLonge received his first guitar shortly thereafter and began writing original punk rock songs . He formed Blink-182 with bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor during his high school years . The band created a following in the mid-1990s through independent releases and relentless touring , particularly in their home country and in Australia . They signed to MCA Records in 1996 and their second album , Dude Ranch ( 1997 ) , featured the hit single `` Dammit '' .   The group encountered bigger success with Enema of the State ( 1999 ) , which featured three hit singles and went quadruple-platinum in the US , eventually selling upwards of 15 million copies worldwide . Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001 's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket . DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer , which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002 , but dissolved the following year . Blink 's eponymous fifth studio album ( 2003 ) reflected a change in tone within the group , which broke up in 2005 following internal tension , spearheaded by DeLonge .   In the aftermath of Blink-182 's breakup , he formed Angels & Airwaves , which has since released five studio albums and has evolved into an `` art project '' , encompassing various forms of media .

He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high , and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen . After moving to San Diego in 1992 , Hoppus ' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge , and together with drummer Scott Raynor , they formed the band Blink-182 .

Diwali or Deepavali is the Hindu festival of lights celebrated every year in autumn in the northern hemisphere ( spring in southern hemisphere ) . It is an official holiday in Fiji , Guyana , India , Malaysia , Mauritius , Myanmar , Nepal , Singapore , Sri Lanka , Suriname , Trinidad and Tobago , and recently Sindh Province in Pakistan . One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism , it spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness , good over evil , knowledge over ignorance , and hope over despair . Its celebration includes millions of lights shining on housetops , outside doors and windows , around temples and other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed . The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period , but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with the darkest , new moon night of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika in Bikram Sambat calendar . In the Gregorian calendar , Diwali night falls between mid-October and mid-November .   Before Diwali night , people clean , renovate , and decorate their homes and offices . On Diwali night , people dress up in new clothes or their best outfit , light up diyas ( lamps and candles ) inside and outside their home , participate in family puja ( prayers ) typically to Lakshmi -- the goddess of fertility and prosperity . After puja , fireworks follow , then a family feast including mithai ( sweets ) , and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends . Deepavali also marks a major shopping period in nations where it is celebrated .   The name of festive days as well as the rituals of Diwali vary significantly among Hindus , based on the region of India . In many parts of India , the festivities start with Dhanteras ( in Northern and Western part of India ) , followed by Naraka Chaturdasi on second day , Deepavali on the third day , Diwali Padva dedicated to wife -- husband relationship on the fourth day , and festivities end with Bhai Dooj dedicated to sister -- brother bond on the fifth day . Dhanteras usually falls eighteen days after Dussehra .   On the same night that Hindus celebrate Diwali , Jains celebrate a festival also called Diwali to mark the attainment of moksha by Mahavira , Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal Empire prison , and Newar Buddhists , unlike the majority of Buddhists , celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi .

The Bahamas ( [ bəˈhɑːməz ] ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago . It consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands ; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The designation of `` the Bahamas '' can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands . As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force , the Bahamas territory encompasses 180000 sqmi of ocean space .   The Bahamas is the site of Columbus ' first landfall in the New World in 1492 . At that time , the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people . Although the Spanish never colonised the Bahamas , they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola . The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera .   The Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American War of Independence , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas ; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period . The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves : the Royal Navy resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships ; American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida ; and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather . Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 . Today the descendants of slaves and free Africans make up nearly 90 % of the population ; issues related to the slavery years are part of society .   The Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973 , retaining Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch . In terms of gross domestic product per capita , the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas ( following the United States and Canada ) , with an economy based on tourism and finance .

Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , ( 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 ) was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis ( of which he had been one of the architects ) , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community .   Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth .   Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage . 
A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government , often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system . In many systems , the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet , and allocates posts to members within the government . In most systems , the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet . In a minority of systems , notably in semi-presidential systems of government , a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state .   In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system , the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch . In such systems , the head of state or the head of state 's official representative ( i.e. the monarch , president , or governor-general ) usually holds a largely ceremonial position , although often with reserve powers .   The prime minister is often , but not always , a member of the Legislature or the Lower House thereof and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature . In some monarchies the monarch may also exercise executive powers ( known as the royal prerogative ) that are constitutionally vested in the crown and may be exercised without the approval of parliament .   As well as being head of government , a prime minister may have other roles or titles -- the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , for example , is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service . Prime ministers may take other ministerial posts . For example , during the Second World War , Winston Churchill was also Minister of Defence ( although there was then no Ministry of Defence ) and in the current cabinet of Israel , Benjamin Netanyahu also serves as Minister of Communications , Foreign Affairs , Regional Cooperation , Economy and Interior .

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . ",1,0.91,5,38,152,96,736

Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , ( ; 13 October 1925 -- 8 April 2013 ) was a British stateswoman , who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and as Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher ( of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire ) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist .

Starrcade was an annual professional wrestling event , originally broadcast via closed-circuit television and eventually broadcast via pay-per-view television , held from 1983 to 2000 by the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) and later World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) . Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year , much in the same vein that its rival , the World Wrestling Entertainment , regards WrestleMania . As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .   From 1983 to 1987 , Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions ( JCP ) , the dominant promotion of the NWA , and aired on Thanksgiving Day . In 1987 , the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own , Survivor Series , on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event . In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum . In 1983 , JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition , and spread it across its territory on closed-circuit television .

Alice Cooper ( born Vincent Damon Furnier ; February 4 , 1948 ) is an American singer , songwriter , and actor whose career spans over five decades . With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper .

Francis I ( François Ier ) ( 12 September 1494 -- 31 March 1547 ) was the first King of France from the Angoulême branch of the House of Valois , reigning from 1515 until his death . He was the son of Charles , Count of Angoulême , and Louise of Savoy . He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII , who died without a male heir .   A prodigious patron of the arts , he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Château de Chambord , including Leonardo da Vinci , who brought the Mona Lisa with him , which Francis had acquired . Francis ' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France , the spread of humanism and Protestantism , and the beginning of French exploration of the New World . Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire .   For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language , he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres ( the `` Father and Restorer of Letters '' ) . He was also known as François au Grand Nez ( `` Francis of the Large Nose '' ) , the Grand Colas , and the Roi-Chevalier ( the `` Knight-King '' ) for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V.   Following the policy of his predecessors , Francis continued the Italian Wars . The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands , the throne of Spain , and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor , meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy . In his struggle against Imperial hegemony , he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold . When this was unsuccessful , he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent , a controversial move for a Christian king at the time . ",1,1.4,8,35,247,81,630

Speech recognition ( SR ) is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers . It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems .

The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music , but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success ; as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s , and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s . The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies ; Robin 's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits , while Barry 's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s . The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits , as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists .   Born on the Isle of Man to English parents , the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton , Manchester , England , until the late 1950s where they formed the Rattlesnakes . The family then moved to Redcliffe , in Queensland , Australia , and then to Cribb Island . After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with `` Spicks and Specks '' ( their 12th single ) , they returned to the UK in January 1967 where producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience .   The Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists of all time . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 ; the presenter of the award to `` Britain 's first family of harmony '' was Brian Wilson , historical leader of the Beach Boys , a `` family act '' also featuring three harmonising brothers . The Bee Gees ' Hall of Fame citation says `` Only Elvis Presley , the Beatles , Michael Jackson , Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees . ''   Following Maurice 's death in January 2003 at the age of 53 , Barry and Robin retired the group 's name after 45 years of activity . In 2009 Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again . Robin died in May 2012 at the age of 62 , after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems , leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group 's final line up . 
Robin Hugh Gibb ( 22 December 1949 -- 20 May 2012 ) was a British singer , songwriter and record producer , who gained worldwide fame as a member of the pop group the Bee Gees . Their younger brother Andy was also a singer . Robin Gibb also had his own successful solo career .   Gibb was born on the Isle of Man to English parents , Hugh and Barbara Gibb ; the family later moved to Manchester ( where Andy was born ) before settling in Redcliffe , a suburb of Brisbane , Australia . Gibb began his career as part of the family trio ( Barry-Maurice-Robin ) . When the group found their first success , they returned to England where they achieved worldwide fame . In 2002 , the Bee Gees were appointed as CBEs for their `` contribution to music '' . However , investiture at Buckingham Palace was delayed until 2004 .   With record sales estimated in excess of 200 million units , the Bee Gees became one of the most successful pop groups of all time . Music historian Paul Gambaccini described Gibb as `` one of the major figures in the history of British music '' and `` one of the best white soul voices ever '' . From 2008 to 2011 , Gibb was President of the Heritage Foundation , honouring figures in British culture . After a career spanning six decades , Gibb last performed on stage in February 2012 supporting injured British servicemen and women at a charity concert at the London Palladium . On 20 May 2012 , Gibb died at the age of 62 from liver and kidney failure brought on by colorectal cancer .   As an instrumentalist , Gibb primarily played a variety of keyboards , notably piano , organ and Mellotron on the Bee Gees album Odessa ( 1969 ) ; he also played acoustic guitar and organ on his debut solo album Robin 's Reign ( 1970 ) . 
The Rattlesnakes were a British skiffle/rock and roll group , formed by Barry Gibb in Manchester in 1955 , which eventually evolved into the Bee Gees in 1958 . They were one of the many skiffle bands that were formed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s since the revival of the American skiffle in the UK that was originally started in the 1920s , 1930s and 1940s .   Barry started a skiffle group which his younger brothers Robin and Maurice Gibb also joined as vocalists , after they returned to their parents ' hometown in Manchester , England in 1955 . Their friends/neighbors , Paul Frost ( drums ) and Kenny Horrocks ( tea-chest bass ) later joined . Their debut performance in public happened in December 1957 in Gaumont Cinema , performing The Everly Brothers ' `` Wake Up Little Susie '' . Some of their influences at that time were Elvis Presley , The Everly Brothers , Tommy Steele , Buddy Holly and Paul Anka .   On 12 January 2003 , Maurice died unexpectedly at the age of 53 , of a cardiac arrest , while waiting to undergo surgery for a twisted intestine . On 20 May 2012 , Robin died at the age of 62 from liver and kidney failure . On 17 November 2012 , Frost died in England after a long battle with cancer at age 64 . As of 2015 , Barry Gibb and Kenny Horrocks were the only remaining survivors of The Rattlesnakes .

The Battle of France , also known as the Fall of France , was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries during the Second World War . In six weeks from 10 May 1940 , German forces defeated Allied forces by mobile operations and conquered France , Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands , bringing land operations on the Western Front to an end until 6 June 1944 . Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940 and attempted an invasion of France .   The German plan for the invasion consisted of two main operations . In Fall Gelb ( Case Yellow ) , German armoured units pushed through the Ardennes and then along the Somme valley , cutting off and surrounding the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium , to meet the expected German invasion . When British , Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the mobile and well-organised German operation , the British evacuated the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) and several French divisions from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo .   After the withdrawal of the BEF , the German forces began Fall Rot ( Case Red ) on 5 June . The sixty remaining French divisions made a determined resistance but were unable to overcome the German air superiority and armoured mobility . German tanks outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France . German forces occupied Paris unopposed on 14 June after a chaotic period of flight of the French government that led to a collapse of the French army . German commanders met with French officials on 18 June with the goal of forcing the new French government to accept an armistice that amounted to surrender .   On 22 June , the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed by France and Germany , which resulted in a division of France . The neutral Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain superseded the Third Republic and Germany occupied the north and west . Italy took control a small occupation zone in the south-east and the Vichy regime was left in control of unoccupied territory in the south known as the zone libre . The Germans occupied the zone under Fall Anton in November 1942 , until the Allied liberation in the summer of 1944 . ",1,0.9300000000000002,4,16,66,130,890

Sid Meier 's Civilization IV is a turn-based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the Civilization series . It was designed by Soren Johnson under the direction of Sid Meier and his video game development studio Firaxis Games . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia , between October 25 and November 4 , 2005 .   Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay , in which the player 's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources . Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC . As with other games in the series , there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game : conquering all other civilizations , controlling a supermajority of the game world 's land and population , building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system , increasing the `` Culture ratings '' of at least three different cities to `` legendary '' levels , or winning a `` World Leader '' popularity contest by the United Nations . If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players , the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner . A large departure from earlier Civilization games is a new graphics engine created from scratch , based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited ( NDL ) .   The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre . Civilization IV has sold 3 million copies and won multiple awards , including several Game of the Year awards . In addition to this , Firaxis Games has also released two major expansions , Civilization IV : Warlords and Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword , as well as the standalone game Civilization IV : Colonization , which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled Sid Meier 's Civilization IV : The Complete Edition .

When used to define a specific genre or type of film or television programme , drama is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as `` political drama , '' `` courtroom drama , '' historical drama , '' `` domestic drama , '' or `` comedy-drama . '' These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods .   All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , `` drama '' came to be used within the theatre as a generic term to describe a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . `` Radio drama '' has been used in both senses -- originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . 
A prison film is a film genre concerned with prison life and often prison escape . These films range from acclaimed dramas examining the nature of prisons , such as Cool Hand Luke , Midnight Express , Brubaker , Escape from Alcatraz , The Shawshank Redemption , and Kiss of the Spider Woman to actioners like Lock Up and Undisputed , and even comedies satirizing the genre like Stir Crazy , Life , and Let 's Go To Prison .   Themes repeatedly visited in the action films include escape attempts , gang activities inside the prison , guard and management cruelty , and an entire subgenre of films where the toughest prisoners are permitted ( or forced ) to engage in boxing matches or martial arts bouts , replete with high-stakes wagering on the outcomes . These elements may be meshed together , where for example a prisoner forced to fight uses the occasion to plan an escape .

C. chinense varieties are well known for their exceptional heat and unique flavors . The hottest peppers in the world are members of this species , with Scoville Heat Unit scores of over 1.5 million . Some taxonomists consider them to be part of the species C. annuum , and they are a member of the C. annuum complex . C. annuum and C. chinense pepper plants can generally be identified by the number of flowers or fruit per node , however -- one for C. annuum and two to five for C. chinense , though this method is not always correct . The two species can also hybridize and generate inter-specific hybrids . It is believed that C. frutescens is the ancestor to the C. chinense species . ",1,0.6300000000000001,5,12,96,39,293

Ed Wood is a 1994 American biographical period comedy-drama film directed and produced by Tim Burton , and starring Johnny Depp as cult filmmaker Ed Wood . The film concerns the period in Wood 's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi , played by Martin Landau . Sarah Jessica Parker , Patricia Arquette , Jeffrey Jones , Lisa Marie , and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast .   The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts . Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel , Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic , and Michael Lehmann as director . Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads , Lehmann had to vacate the director 's position , which was taken over by Burton .   Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures , but the studio put the film in `` turnaround '' over Burton 's decision to shoot in black-and-white . Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios , which produced the film through the studio 's Touchstone Pictures division . The film was released to critical acclaim , but was a box office bomb , making only $ 5.9 million against an $ 18 million budget .

It concerns a divorced couple who , while honeymooning with their new spouses , discover that they are staying in adjacent rooms at the same hotel . Despite a perpetually stormy relationship , they realise that they still have feelings for each other . Its second act love scene was nearly censored in Britain as too risqué . Coward wrote one of his most popular songs , `` Some Day I 'll Find You '' , for the play .   After touring the British provinces , the play opened the new Phoenix Theatre in London in 1930 , starring Coward , Gertrude Lawrence , Adrianne Allen and Laurence Olivier . A Broadway production followed in 1931 , and the play has been revived at least a half dozen times each in the West End and on Broadway . The leading roles have attracted a wide range of actors ; among those who have succeeded Coward as Elyot are Robert Stephens , Richard Burton , Alan Rickman and Matthew Macfadyen , and successors to Lawrence as Amanda have included Tallulah Bankhead , Elizabeth Taylor , Maggie Smith , Kim Cattrall and Lindsay Duncan .

Earl Eugene Scruggs ( January 6 , 1924 -- March 28 , 2012 ) was an American musician noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo picking style , now called `` Scruggs style '' , that is a defining characteristic of bluegrass music . His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the ways the five-string banjo had been historically played . He popularized the instrument in several genres of music and elevated the banjo from its role as a background rhythm instrument , or a comedian 's prop , into featured solo status .   Scruggs ' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in a group called `` Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys '' . The name `` bluegrass '' stuck and eventually became the eponym for this entire genre of county music . Despite considerable success with Monroe , performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits like `` Blue Moon of Kentucky '' , Scruggs gave notice in 1946 that he was quitting the band because of the exhausting touring schedule . Band member Lester Flatt resigned as well , and Flatt and Scruggs later paired up in a new group they called `` Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys '' . Scruggs ' banjo instrumental called `` Foggy Mountain Breakdown '' , released in 1949 , became an enduring hit , and had a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde . The song won two Grammy Awards and in 2005 was selected for the Library of Congress ' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit .   Flatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit , `` The Ballad of Jed Clampett '' . This song was the theme music for the successful network television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies and was the first bluegrass recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts . Over their 20-year association , Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records . The duo broke up in 1969 , chiefly because Scruggs wanted to progress the music to a more modern sound and Flatt was a traditionalist who did not want to change the style because he thought it would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists . Each of them formed a new band that matched his own vision , but neither of them ever regained the success they achieved as a team .   Scruggs received four Grammy awards , a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts . He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood walk of fame . In 1985 , Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named number 24 as a duo on CMT 's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music . Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts ; the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the US . Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the Grammy Hall of Fame . After Scruggs ' death in 2012 at age 88 , the Earl Scruggs Center was founded near his birthplace in Shelby , North Carolina , with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors . The center is a $ 5.5 million facility which features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students .

The Quran ( [ kɔrˈɑːn ] ; القرآن , literally meaning `` the recitation '' ; also romanized Qur ` an or Koran ) is the central religious text of Islam , which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God ( Allah ) . It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir . ",1,0.56,3,11,40,51,401

Manmohan Singh ( [ mənˈmoːɦən ˈsɪ́ŋɡ ] ; born 26 September 1932 ) is an Indian economist and politician who served as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014 . The first Sikh in office , Singh was also the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term .   Born in Gah ( now in Punjab , Pakistan ) , Singh 's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947 . After obtaining his doctorate in economics from Oxford , Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966 -- 69 . He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade . Over the 70s and 80s , Singh held several key posts in the Government of India , such as Chief Economic Advisor ( 1972 -- 76 ) , Reserve Bank governor ( 1982 -- 85 ) and Planning Commission head ( 1985 -- 87 ) .   In 1991 , as India faced a severe economic crisis , newly elected Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao surprisingly inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as Finance Minister . Over the next few years , despite strong opposition , he as a Finance Minister carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India 's economy . Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis , and enhanced Singh 's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist , the incumbent Congress party fared poorly in the 1996 general election . Subsequently , Singh served as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha ( the upper house of India 's Parliament ) during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1998 -- 2004 .   In 2004 , when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) came to power , its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh . Singh 's first ministry executed several key legislations and projects , including the Rural Health Mission , Unique Identification Authority , Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act . In 2008 , opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh 's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support . Although India 's economy grew rapidly under UPA I , its security was threatened by several terrorist incidents ( including the 2008 Mumbai attacks ) and the continuing Maoist insurgency .   The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate , with Singh retaining the office of Prime Minister . Over the next few years , Singh 's second ministry government faced a number of corruption charges -- over the organisation of the Commonwealth Games , the 2G-spectrum allocation and the allocation of coal blocks . After his term ended in 2014 he opted out from the race to the office of the Prime Minister of India during 2014 Indian general election . Singh was never a member of the Lok Sabha but continues to serve as a member of the Indian Parliament , representing the state of Assam in the Rajya Sabha for the fifth consecutive term since 1991 .

Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned . ",1,1.05,7,42,168,89,538

The arms industry , also known as the defense industry or the arms trade , is a global industry responsible for the manufacturing and sales of weapons and military technology . It consists of a commercial industry involved in the research and development , engineering , production , and servicing of military material , equipment , and facilities . Arms-producing companies , also referred to as arms dealers , defense contractors , or as the military industry , produce arms for the armed forces of states and civilians . Departments of government also operate in the arms industry , buying and selling weapons , munitions and other military items . An arsenal is a place where arms and ammunition are made , maintained and repaired , stored , or issued , in any combination , whether privately or publicly owned . Products include guns , artillery , ammunition , missiles , military aircraft , military vehicles , ships , electronic systems , night vision devices , holographic weapon sights , laser rangefinders , laser sights , hand grenades , landmines and more . The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support .   Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) estimated in 2012 that 2012 military expenditures were roughly 1.8 trillion United States dollars . This represents a relative decline from 1990 when military expenditures made up 4 % of world GDP . Part of the money goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry . The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms-producing companies amounted to an estimated $ 395 billion in 2012 according to SIPRI . In 2004 over $ 30 billion were spent in the international arms trade ( a figure that excludes domestic sales of arms ) . According to SIPRI , the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010 -- 14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005 -- 2009 . The ﬁve biggest exporters in 2010 -- 2014 were the United States , Russia , China , Germany and France , and the ﬁve biggest importers were India , Saudi Arabia , China , the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan .   Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces . Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens , primarily for self-defense , hunting or sporting purposes . Illegal trade in small arms occurs in many countries and regions affected by political instability . The Small Arms Survey estimates that 875 million small arms circulate worldwide , produced by more than 1,000 companies from nearly 100 countries .   Contracts to supply a given country 's military are awarded by governments , making arms contracts of substantial political importance . The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development of what U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower described as a military-industrial complex , where the armed forces , commerce , and politics become closely linked , similarly to the European multilateral defence procurement . Various corporations , some publicly held , others private , bid for these contracts , which are often worth many billions of dollars . Sometimes , as with the contract for the international Joint Strike Fighter , a competitive tendering process takes place , with the decision made on the merits of the designs submitted by the companies involved . Other times , no bidding or competition takes place . 
Efraim Diveroli ( born December 20 , 1985 ) is an American former arms dealer and author . His company , AEY Inc. , was a major weapons contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense . The U.S. government suspended AEY for violating its contract after AEY provided 42-year-old substandard and unserviceable Chinese ammunition and attempted to re-brand and re-package it , thus violating the American arms embargo against China . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Diveroli was 21 and partner David Packouz was 25 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison . He is a subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama comedy film , War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Jonah Hill . ",1,0.65,3,11,33,141,1199

Work continued until 2013 while Gaga was traveling for her Born This Way Ball concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring .   Gaga described Artpop as `` a celebration and a poetic musical journey '' and an exploration of the `` reverse Warholian '' phenomenon in pop culture . It displays an intentional `` lack of maturity and responsibility '' by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way . Gaga collaborated with longtime partners Paul `` DJ White Shadow '' Blair and RedOne and new partners Zedd and Madeon . The lyrical themes revolve around her personal views of fame , love , sex , feminism , self-empowerment , overcoming addiction , and reactions to media scrutiny ; references include Greek and Roman mythology , and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra . Artpop also features guest vocals from T.I. , Too Short , Twista , and R. Kelly .   The release of Artpop was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed an `` ArtRave '' .

Clinton Richard Dawkins ( born 26 March 1941 ) is an English ethologist , evolutionary biologist and author . He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 .   Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .   Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design . In The Blind Watchmaker ( 1986 ) , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms . Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer . In The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion . He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools .

The Quran ( [ kɔrˈɑːn ] ; القرآن , literally meaning `` the recitation '' ; also romanized Qur ` an or Koran ) is the central religious text of Islam , which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God ( Allah ) . It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir . ",1,0.49,3,10,40,51,401

An archipelagic state is any internationally recognized state or country that comprises a series of islands that form an archipelago . The term is defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to define what borders such states should be allowed to claim .   In various conferences , Fiji , Indonesia , Papua New Guinea , the Bahamas , and the Philippines are the five sovereign states that obtained approval in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea signed in Montego Bay , Jamaica on December 10 , 1982 and qualified as archipelagic states .   Archipelagic states are states that are composed of groups of islands forming a state as a single unit , with the islands and the waters within the baselines as internal waters . Under this concept ( `` archipelagic doctrine '' ) , an archipelago shall be regarded as a single unit , so that the waters around , between , and connecting the islands of the archipelago , irrespective of their breadth and dimensions , form part of the internal waters of the state , and are subject to its exclusive sovereignty .   The approval of the United Nations for the five sovereign states as archipelagic states respect existing agreements with other countries and shall recognize traditional fishing rights and other legitimate activities of the immediately adjacent neighboring countries in certain areas falling within archipelagic waters . The terms and conditions for the exercise of such rights and activities , including the nature , the extent and the areas to which they apply , shall , at the request of any of the countries concerned , be regulated by bilateral agreements between them . Such rights shall not be transferred to or shared with third countries or their nationals . 
The Bahamas ( [ bəˈhɑːməz ] ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago . It consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands ; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The designation of `` the Bahamas '' can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands . As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force , the Bahamas territory encompasses 180000 sqmi of ocean space .   The Bahamas is the site of Columbus ' first landfall in the New World in 1492 . At that time , the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people . Although the Spanish never colonised the Bahamas , they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola . The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera .   The Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American War of Independence , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas ; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period . The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves : the Royal Navy resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships ; American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida ; and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather . Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 . Today the descendants of slaves and free Africans make up nearly 90 % of the population ; issues related to the slavery years are part of society .   The Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973 , retaining Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch . In terms of gross domestic product per capita , the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas ( following the United States and Canada ) , with an economy based on tourism and finance .

Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo .   In 1968 , the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads '' or `` headbangers '' .   During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre . These include groove metal ( with bands such as Pantera , Sepultura , and Lamb of God ) and nu metal ( with bands such as Korn , Slipknot , and Linkin Park ) , the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop .

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease and motor neurone disease ( MND ) , is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles . Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common . ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life . The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50 . The average survival from onset to death is two to four years . About 10 % survive longer than 10 years . Most die from respiratory failure . In much of the world , rates of ALS are unknown . In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year .   Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell . In 1869 , the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot , who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking , diagnosed in 1963 and expected to die within two years , became famous .

North Vietnam , officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRV ) , was a state in Southeast Asia which existed from 1945 to 1976 . Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh declared independence from France on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh , led by Ho . The Viet Minh ( `` League for the Independence of Vietnam '' ) was a coalition of nationalist groups , mostly led by communists . In February 1951 , the communists announced the creation of the Lao Động Party ( Labor Party ) , gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Việt Minh .   Between 1946 and 1954 , the Việt Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam . In 1954 , after the French were defeated , the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Việt Minh and granted Vietnam independence . The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones , and stipulated general elections in July 1956 `` to bring about the unification of Viet-Nam '' . The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam , and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam .   Supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India , Canada and Poland . The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords but instead stated that the U.S. `` shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly . '' In July 1955 , the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam , Ngô Đình Diệm , announced that the Republic of Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country . He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva accords and was not bound by it .   With the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War ( 1955 -- 75 ) . North Vietnam and the Việt Cộng insurgents supported by their communist allies , including the Soviet Union and China , fought against the military of South Vietnam , the U.S. and other anti-communist military forces , including South Korea , Australia , Thailand and smaller players . North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments . The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Việt Cộng defeated the Republic of Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam .

The Bee Gees  were a pop music group formed in 1958 . Their line-up consisted of brothers Barry , Robin and Maurice Gibb . The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music , but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success ; as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s , and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s . The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies ; Robin 's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits , while Barry 's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s . The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits , as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists .   Born on the Isle of Man to English parents , the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton , Manchester , England , until the late 1950s where they formed the Rattlesnakes . The family then moved to Redcliffe , in Queensland , Australia , and then to Cribb Island . After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with `` Spicks and Specks '' ( their 12th single ) , they returned to the UK in January 1967 where producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience .   The Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists of all time . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 ; the presenter of the award to `` Britain 's first family of harmony '' was Brian Wilson , historical leader of the Beach Boys , a `` family act '' also featuring three harmonising brothers . The Bee Gees ' Hall of Fame citation says `` Only Elvis Presley , the Beatles , Michael Jackson , Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees . ''   Following Maurice 's death in January 2003 at the age of 53 , Barry and Robin retired the group 's name after 45 years of activity . In 2009 Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again . Robin died in May 2012 at the age of 62 , after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems , leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group 's final line up .

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . [ 25 ] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . [ 33 ] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , [ 34 ] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . [ 35 ]   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . [ 28 ] From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront . ",1,1.84,9,72,362,96,736

Lithuanians '' ' ( lietuviai , singular lietuvis/lietuv ė '' ) are a Baltic ethnic group , native to Lithuania , where they number around 2,561,300 people . Another million or more make up the Lithuanian diaspora , largely found in countries such as the United States , Argentina , Brazil , Canada , Colombia , Russia , United Kingdom and Ireland . Their native language is Lithuanian , one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family . According to the census conducted in 2001 , 83.45 % of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians , 6.74 % as Poles , 6.31 % as Russians , 1.23 % as Belarusians , and 2.27 % as members of other ethnic groups . Most Lithuanians belong to the Roman Catholic Church , while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II , were mostly Evangelical Lutherans . 
An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral , language , social , cultural or national experiences . Unlike other social groups ( wealth , age , hobbies ) , ethnicity is often an inherited status based on the society in which one lives . In some cases , it can be adopted if a person moves into another society . Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage , ancestry , origin myth , history , homeland , language or dialect , symbolic systems such as religion , mythology and ritual , cuisine , dressing style , art , and physical appearance .   Ethnic groups , derived from the same historical founder population , often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool . By way of language shift , acculturation , adoption and religious conversion , it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to leave one ethnic group and become part of another ( except for ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity as a key membership criterion ) .   Ethnicity is often used synonymously with ambiguous terms such as nation or people . In English , it can also have the connotation of something exotic ( cf. `` White ethnic '' , `` ethnic restaurant '' , etc. ) , generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants , who arrived after the founding population of an area was established .   Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership , the following types of ( often mutually overlapping ) groups can be identified :  Ethno-linguistic , emphasizing shared language , dialect ( and possibly script ) -- example : Slavs  Ethno-national , emphasizing a shared polity or sense of national identity -- example : Iraqis  Ethno-racial , emphasizing shared physical appearance based on genetic origins -- example : African Americans  Ethno-regional , emphasizing a distinct local sense of belonging stemming from relative geographic isolation -- example : South Islanders  Ethno-religious , emphasizing shared affiliation with a particular religion , denomination or sect -- example : Sikhs   In many cases -- for instance , the sense of Jewish peoplehood -- more than one aspect determines membership .   The largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals ( Han Chinese being the largest ) , while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals ( numerous indigenous peoples worldwide ) . Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as tribes or clans , which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group . Conversely , formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity , and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity . Whether through division or amalgamation , the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis . ",1,0.42,4,3,18,134,653

Libya is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa , bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north , Egypt to the east , Sudan to the southeast , Chad and Niger to the south and Algeria and Tunisia to the west . The country is made of three historical regions , Tripolitania , Fezzan and Cyrenaica . With an area of almost 1.8 e6km2 , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa , and is the 16th largest country in the world . Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world .   The largest city and capital , Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya 's six million people . The other large city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya .   Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age . The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya , and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya . Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire . Libya was an early centre of Christianity . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century , when invasions brought Islam and Arab colonisation . In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 . Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries . Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943 . During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign . The Italian population then went into decline . Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951 .   A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I , beginning a period of sweeping social reform . The most prominent coup figure , Muammar Gaddafi , was ultimately able to have power fully concentrated in his hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution , remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011 , fought by those supporting the government and by forces attempting to overthrow it , in which the rebels were supported by NATO . Since then , Libya has experienced a period of instability . The European Union is involved in an operation intended to disrupt human trafficking networks exploiting refugees fleeing from wars in Africa for Europe .   As part of the ongoing second Libyan Civil War ( 2014 -- present ) , at least two political bodies claim to be the government of Libya . The Council of Deputies is one such government , but it does not hold territory in the capital , Tripoli , instead meeting in the Cyrenaica city of Tobruk . Meanwhile , the UN-backed 2014 General National Congress purports to be the legal continuation of the General National Congress , elected in the 2012 Libyan General National Congress election and dissolved following the June 2014 elections but then reconvened by a minority of its members . The Supreme Court in the Libya Dawn and General National Congress-controlled Tripoli declared the Tobruk government unconstitutional in November 2014 , but the body has rejected the ruling as made under threat of violence .   Parts of Libya are outside of either government 's control , with various Islamist , rebel , and tribal militias administering some cities and areas . The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between the Tobruk - and Tripoli-based factions . An agreement to form a unified interim government was signed on 17 December 2015 . Under the terms of the agreement , a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would be formed , with a view to holding new elections within two years . The leaders of the new government , called the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) , arrived in Tripoli on 5 April 2016 . Since then the GNC , one of the two rival governments , has disbanded to support the new GNA . ",1,0.91,7,17,48,54,391

Invasion literature ( or the invasion novel ) is a literary genre most notable between 1871 and the First World War ( 1914 ) but still practised to this day . The genre first became recognizable starting in Britain in 1871 with The Battle of Dorking , a fictional account of an invasion of England by Germany . This short story was so popular it started a literary craze for tales that aroused imaginations and anxieties about hypothetical invasions by foreign powers , and by 1914 the genre had amassed a corpus of over 400 books , many best-sellers , and a world-wide audience . The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics , national policies and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War , and remains a part of popular culture to this day . Several of the books were written by or ghostwritten for military officers and experts of the day who believed that the nation would be saved if the particular tactic that they favoured was or would be adopted .

Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen ( and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship ) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .   In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 , and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .   In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens . Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International . On 1 July 2015 , Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox . Murdoch and his family own both 21st Century Fox and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust .

It built upon the success of his previous effort , New Moon Shine .   Hourglass was an introspective album that earned Taylor his best critical reviews in almost twenty years . The album 's lyrics focused largely on Taylor 's troubled past and family . `` Jump Up Behind Me '' paid tribute to his father 's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days , and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill . `` Enough to Be On Your Way '' was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade . The themes were also inspired by Taylor 's divorce from actress Kathryn Walker , which took place in 1996 . Rolling Stone found that `` one of the themes of this record is disbelief '' , while Taylor told the magazine that it was `` spirituals for agnostics . '' Critics embraced the dark themes on the album , and Hourglass was a huge commercial success , reaching # 9 on the Billboard 200 ( Taylor 's first Top 10 album in sixteen years ) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on `` Little More Time With You '' .

As the city has become a leading center in the country , so has the surrounding metropolitan area , a major industrial and paramount metropolis in northwestern Mexico . Currently one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Mexico , Tijuana maintains global city status . , the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,696,923 .   Tijuana is located on the Gold Coast of Baja California , and is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality . Tijuana covers 70 % of the municipality but contains over 80 % of its population . A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent , the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies . In the early 21st century , Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America . Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca . The city is the most visited border city in the globe ; sharing a border of about 24 km with its sister city San Diego . More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year . This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the busiest land-border crossing in the world . It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone .   Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico . According to the 2010 census , the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico , with a population of 1,784,034 , but rankings vary , the city ( locality ) itself was 6th largest and the municipality ( administrative ) 3rd largest nationally . The international metropolitan region was estimated to be just over five million in 2009 and about 5,105,769 in 2010 , making it the third largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region , 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas , and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico . Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego ; during the 2000s the drug violence had residents moving out of the congested urban core into isolated communities within the municipality and beyond , as evidenced by 2010 Census figures and growth patterns .   Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias . As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , Tijuana 's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure . The city was founded in July 11 , 1889 as urban development began . Often known by its initials , T.J. , and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico , the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s . ",1,0.42,4,4,18,88,348

Artpop ( stylized as ARTPOP ) is the third studio album by American singer Lady Gaga , released on November 6 , 2013 , by Streamline and Interscope Records .

Work continued until 2013 while Gaga was traveling for her Born This Way Ball concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring .   Gaga described Artpop as `` a celebration and a poetic musical journey '' and an exploration of the `` reverse Warholian '' phenomenon in pop culture . It displays an intentional `` lack of maturity and responsibility '' by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way . Gaga collaborated with longtime partners Paul `` DJ White Shadow '' Blair and RedOne and new partners Zedd and Madeon . The lyrical themes revolve around her personal views of fame , love , sex , feminism , self-empowerment , overcoming addiction , and reactions to media scrutiny ; references include Greek and Roman mythology , and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra .

Juventus Football Club S.p.A. ( from Latin iuventūs , `` youth '' ; [ juˈvɛntus ] ) , colloquially known as Juve ( [ ˈjuːve ] ) , is a professional Italian association football club based in Turin , Piedmont , founded in 1897 by a group of young Torinese students , among them was their first president Eugenio Canfari and his brother Enrico , author of the company 's historical memory . The club is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section ( 1893 ) , has traditionally worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played its home matches in several grounds , being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Juventus is also the most successful club in Italian football , the one that has the most sporting tradition in the country and one of the most awarded globally having won overall sixty-three official titles on the national and international stage , more than any other club in Italy : a record thirty-three official league titles , a record twelve Coppa Italia titles , a record seven Supercoppa Italiana titles and , with eleven titles in confederation and inter-confederation competitions ( two Intercontinental Cups , two European Champion Clubs ' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup ) it ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won .   Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus initially as a athletics club , it has spent uninterruptedly in the top flight league system ( reformulated as Serie A since 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006 -- 07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family since 1923 to 1943 and since 1947 until the date . The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country . Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s . Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the ( now-defunct ) Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup ( the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament ) . With its successive triumphs in the Super Cup in 1984 and in the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the club become also the first in the world -- and remains the only one at present -- to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies , an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999 . In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .   The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters groups -- often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin -- , it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and abroad , mainly in countries with a significant presence of Italian immigrants , making Juventus a symbol of campanilismo ( `` Anti-parochialism '' ) and italianità ( `` Italianness '' ) along with the club 's tradition of success , some of which have had a significant impact in Italian society , especially in the 1930s and the first post-war decade , as well as the ideological politics and socio-economic origin of the club 's sympathisers and the club 's contribution to the national team -- the most for an Italian club -- , uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football , having performed a decisive role in the Azzurri 's World Cup triumphs of 1934 , 1982 and 2006 .

The Battle of France , also known as the Fall of France , was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries during the Second World War . In six weeks from 10 May 1940 , German forces defeated Allied forces by mobile operations and conquered France , Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands , bringing land operations on the Western Front to an end until 6 June 1944 . Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940 and attempted an invasion of France .   The German plan for the invasion consisted of two main operations . In Fall Gelb ( Case Yellow ) , German armoured units pushed through the Ardennes and then along the Somme valley , cutting off and surrounding the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium , to meet the expected German invasion . When British , Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the mobile and well-organised German operation , the British evacuated the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) and several French divisions from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo .   After the withdrawal of the BEF , the German forces began Fall Rot ( Case Red ) on 5 June . The sixty remaining French divisions made a determined resistance but were unable to overcome the German air superiority and armoured mobility . German tanks outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France . German forces occupied Paris unopposed on 14 June after a chaotic period of flight of the French government that led to a collapse of the French army . German commanders met with French officials on 18 June with the goal of forcing the new French government to accept an armistice that amounted to surrender .   On 22 June , the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed by France and Germany , which resulted in a division of France . The neutral Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain superseded the Third Republic and Germany occupied the north and west . Italy took control a small occupation zone in the south-east and the Vichy regime was left in control of unoccupied territory in the south known as the zone libre . The Germans occupied the zone under Fall Anton in November 1942 , until the Allied liberation in the summer of 1944 . ",1,0.6300000000000001,4,12,73,130,890

The Premier League is an English professional league for men 's association football clubs . At the top of the English football league system , it is the country 's primary football competition . Contested by 20 clubs , it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League ( EFL ; known as `` The Football League '' before 2016 -- 17 ) . Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify .   The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders . Seasons run from August to May . Teams play 38 matches each ( playing each team in the league twice , home and away ) , totalling 380 matches in the season . Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons ; others during weekday evenings . It is colloquially known as the Premiership and outside the UK it is commonly referred to as the English Premier League ( EPL ) .   The competition formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League , which was founded in 1888 , and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal . The deal was worth # 1 billion a year domestically as of 2013 -- 14 , with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively . The league generates $ 2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights . In 2014/15 , teams were apportioned revenues of # 1.6 billion .   The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world , broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people . In the 2014 -- 15 season , the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000 , second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga 's 43,500 . Most stadium occupancies are near capacity . The Premier League ranks third in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons .   While 47 clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992 , only six have won the title : Manchester United ( 13 ) , Chelsea ( 5 ) , Arsenal ( 3 ) , Manchester City ( 2 ) , Blackburn Rovers ( 1 ) and Leicester City ( 1 ) . The current champions are Chelsea , who secured the 2016 -- 17 title in early May 2017 . 
West Ham United Football Club is a professional football club based in Stratford , East London , England . They compete in the Premier League , the top tier of English football . In 2016 the club re-located to the London Stadium .   The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United . They moved to the Boleyn Ground in 1904 , which remained their home ground for more than a century . The team initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before joining the Football League in 1919 . They were promoted to the top flight in 1923 , when they were also losing finalists in the first FA Cup Final held at Wembley . In 1940 , the club won the inaugural Football League War Cup .   West Ham have been winners of the FA Cup three times , in 1964 , 1975 , and 1980 , and have also been runners-up twice , in 1923 , and 2006 . The club have reached two major European finals , winning the European Cup Winners ' Cup in 1965 and finishing runners-up in the same competition in 1976 . West Ham also won the Intertoto Cup in 1999 . They are one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football , spending 59 of 91 league seasons in the top flight , up to and including the 2016 -- 17 season . The club 's highest league position to date came in 1985 -- 86 when they achieved third place in the then First Division .   Three West Ham players were members of the 1966 World Cup final-winning England team : captain Bobby Moore and goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters . 
The UEFA Intertoto Cup , also abbreviated as UI Cup and originally called the International Football Cup was a summer football competition for European clubs that had not qualified for one of the two major UEFA competitions , the Champions League and the UEFA Cup . The competition was discontinued after the 2008 tournament . Teams who originally would have entered the Intertoto Cup now directly enter the qualifying stages of the UEFA Europa League from this point .   The tournament was founded in 1961 -- 62 , but was only taken over by UEFA in 1995 .   Any club who wished to participate had to apply for entry , with the highest placed clubs ( by league position in their domestic league ) at the end of the season entering the competition . The club did not have to be ranked directly below the clubs which had qualified for another UEFA competition ; if the club which was in that position did not apply , they would not be eligible to compete , with the place instead going to the club which did apply .   The cup billed itself as providing both an opportunity for clubs who otherwise would not get the chance to enter the UEFA Cup and as an opportunity for sports lotteries ( or pools ) to continue during the summer . This reflects its background , which was as a tournament solely for football pools . In 1995 , the tournament came under official UEFA sanctioning and UEFA Cup qualification places were granted . Initially , two were provided ; this was increased to three after one year ; but in 2006 , it was again increased to the final total of 11 . 
The English Football League ( EFL ) is a league competition featuring professional football clubs from England and Wales . Founded in 1888 as the Football League , the league is the oldest such competition in world football . It was the top-level football league in England from its foundation in the 19th century until 1992 , when the top 22 clubs split away to form the Premier League .   The league has 72 clubs evenly divided into three divisions , which are known as the Championship , League One and League Two , with 24 clubs in each division . Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest-placed clubs in the Premier League , and the bottom clubs of League Two to switch with the top clubs of the National League , thus integrating the League into the English football league system . Although primarily a competition for English clubs , clubs from Wales -- currently Newport County and Cardiff City -- also take part , while in the past Swansea City , Wrexham , Merthyr Town and Aberdare Athletic have been members .   The Football League has been associated with a title sponsor between 1983 and 2016 . As this sponsor changed over the years the league too has been known by various names . Starting with the 2016 -- 17 season , the league has moved away from having a title sponsor , rebranding itself as the English Football League ( EFL ) , with a goal of having the EFL brand recognized in a similar way to the EPL brand of the English Premier League .   The English Football League is also the name of the governing body of the league competition , and this body also organises two knock-out cup competitions , the EFL Cup and the EFL Trophy . The operations centre of the Football League is in Preston , while its commercial office is in London . The commercial office was formerly based in Lytham St Annes , after its original spell in Preston . ",1,0.56,4,34,148,494,5716

The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat , single-engine , all-weather stealth multirole fighters . The fifth-generation combat aircraft is designed to perform ground attack and air defense missions . It has three main models : the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing ( CTOL ) variant , the F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing ( STOVL ) variant , and the F-35C carrier-based Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery ( CATOBAR ) variant . On 31 July 2015 , the United States Marines declared ready for deployment the first squadron of F-35B fighters after intensive testing . On 2 August 2016 , the U.S. Air Force declared its first squadron of F-35A fighters combat-ready .   The F-35 descends from the X-35 , the winning design of the Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) program . An aerospace industry team led by Lockheed Martin designed and manufactures it . Other major F-35 industry partners include Northrop Grumman , Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems . The F-35 first flew on 15 December 2006 . The United States plans to buy 2,663 aircraft . Its variants are to provide the bulk of the crewed tactical airpower of the U.S. Air Force , Navy and the Marine Corps over the coming decades . Deliveries of the F-35 for the U.S. military are scheduled until 2037 with a projected service life up to 2070 .   The United States principally funds the F-35 JSF development , with additional funding from partners . The partner nations are either NATO members or close U.S. allies . The United Kingdom , Italy , Australia , Canada , Norway , Denmark , the Netherlands , and Turkey are part of the active development program ; several additional countries have ordered , or are considering ordering , the F-35 .   The program is the most expensive military weapons system in history , and has been much criticized inside and outside government , in the U.S. and in allied countries . Critics argue that the plane is `` plagued with design flaws , '' with many blaming the procurement process in which Lockheed was allowed `` to design , test , and produce the F-35 all at the same time , instead of ... [ identifying and fixing ] defects before firing up its production line . '' By 2014 , the program was `` $ 163 billion over budget [ and ] seven years behind schedule .

The series ' executive producers included Shore , Attanasio , Attanasio 's business partner Katie Jacobs , and film director Bryan Singer . It was filmed largely in Century City .   House often clashes with his fellow physicians , including his own diagnostic team , because many of his hypotheses about patients ' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights .

House 's only true friend is Dr. James Wilson ( Robert Sean Leonard ) , head of the Department of Oncology . During the first three seasons , House 's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase ( Jesse Spencer ) , Dr. Allison Cameron ( Jennifer Morrison ) , and Dr. Eric Foreman ( Omar Epps ) .

Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore , a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota , United States . Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture 's design and oversaw the project 's execution from 1927-1941 with the help of his son , Lincoln Borglum . Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732 -- 1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743 -- 1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858 -- 1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809 -- 1865 ) . The memorial park covers 1278.45 acre and is 5725 ft above sea level .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on Mount Rushmore , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents .   After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project . Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist . Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and it has appeared in works of fiction , as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million visitors annually . ",1,1.4700000000000002,5,27,112,142,735

The story is presented as a flashback , as one survivor reflects upon his experiences in a frame story set in 1980s New York . Several real-life events that occurred during the war , such as the Sant ` Anna di Stazzema massacre , are re-enacted , placing Miracle at St. Anna within the genre of historical fiction .

In Europe , the film 's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini , who helped finance the $ 45 million production . A majority of the film was shot in Italy , on several locations affected by World War II . Other filming locations included New York , Louisiana and The Bahamas . Frequent Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard composed the score , and the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic .   Miracle at St. Anna premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival before it was released on September 26 , 2008 . It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies .

Sid Meier 's Civilization IV is a turn-based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the Civilization series . It was designed by Soren Johnson under the direction of Sid Meier and his video game development studio Firaxis Games . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia , between October 25 and November 4 , 2005 .   Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay , in which the player 's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources . Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC . As with other games in the series , there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game : conquering all other civilizations , controlling a supermajority of the game world 's land and population , building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system , increasing the `` Culture ratings '' of at least three different cities to `` legendary '' levels , or winning a `` World Leader '' popularity contest by the United Nations . If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players , the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner . A large departure from earlier Civilization games is a new graphics engine created from scratch , based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited ( NDL ) .   The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre . Civilization IV has sold 3 million copies and won multiple awards , including several Game of the Year awards . In addition to this , Firaxis Games has also released two major expansions , Civilization IV : Warlords and Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword , as well as the standalone game Civilization IV : Colonization , which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled Sid Meier 's Civilization IV : The Complete Edition .

A monk ( [ mʌŋk ] , from μοναχός , monachos , `` single , solitary '' and Latin monachus ) is a person who practices religious asceticism by monastic living , either alone or with any number of other monks . A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings , or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his or her life in prayer and contemplation . The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy .   In the Greek language the term can apply to women , but in modern English it is mainly in use for men . The word nun is typically used for female monastics .   Although the term monachos is of Christian origin , in the English language `` monk '' tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds . However , being generic , it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk , such as cenobite , hermit , anchorite , hesychast , or solitary . ",1,1.09,3,19,39,84,329

Aaron Burr Jr. ( February 6 , 1756September 14 , 1836 ) was an American politician . He was the third Vice President of the United States ( 1801 -- 1805 ) , serving during Thomas Jefferson 's first term .   Burr served as a Continental Army officer in the Revolutionary War , after which he became a successful lawyer and politician . He was elected twice to the New York State Assembly ( 1784 -- 1785 , 1798 -- 1799 ) , was appointed New York State Attorney General ( 1789 -- 1791 ) , was chosen as a U.S. senator ( 1791 -- 1797 ) , from the State of New York , and reached the apex of his career as vice president .   The highlight of Burr 's tenure as president of the Senate , one of his few official duties as vice president , was the Senate 's first impeachment trial , that of Supreme Court justice Samuel Chase . In 1804 , the last full year of his single term as vice president , Burr killed his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a famous duel . Burr was never tried for the illegal duel , and all charges against him were eventually dropped , but Hamilton 's death ended Burr 's political career .   After leaving Washington , Burr traveled west seeking new opportunities , both economic and political . His activities eventually led to his arrest on charges of treason in 1807 . The subsequent trial resulted in acquittal , but Burr 's western schemes left him with large debts and few influential friends . In a final quest for grand opportunities , he left the United States for Europe . He remained overseas until 1812 , when he returned to the United States to practice law in New York City . There he spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity . 
The Burr -- Hamilton duel was fought between prominent American politicians Aaron Burr , the sitting Vice President of the United States , and Alexander Hamilton , the former Secretary of the Treasury , at Weehawken , New Jersey on July 11 , 1804 . The duel was the culmination of a long and bitter rivalry between the two men . Burr shot and mortally wounded Hamilton , who was carried to the home of William Bayard , where he died the next day with his wife and sister-in-law , Eliza and Angelica Schuyler , at his side .
