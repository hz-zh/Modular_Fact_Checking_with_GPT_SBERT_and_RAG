Conditioned compensatory response (CR) is an automatic response that is opposite to the effect of alcohol or substance usage.
As a result, overdose is usually not due to an increase in dosage, but due to taking the drug in a new place without familiar cues, which would have otherwise allowed the user to tolerate the drug.
CR includes a heightened pain sensitivity, and decreased body temperature, and might cause discomfort, thus motivating the drug user to continue usage of the drug.",NOT ENOUGH INFO,0.9300000000000002

Molecules are ionized using a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light source operating at atmospheric pressure (1 Pa), either by direct absorption followed by electron ejection or through ionization of a dopant molecule that leads to chemical ionization of target molecules.
Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) is a soft ionization method used in mass spectrometry (MS) usually coupled to liquid chromatography (LC).

Reinforced thermoplastic pipe (RTP) is a type of pipe reinforced using a high strength synthetic fibre such as glass, aramid or carbon.
It was initially developed in the early 1990s by Wavin Repox, Akzo Nobel and by Tubes d'Aquitaine from France, who developed the first pipes reinforced with synthetic fibre to replace medium pressure steel pipes in response to growing demand for non-corrosive conduits for application in the onshore oil and gas industry, particularly in the Middle East.1 Typically, the materials used in the construction of the pipe might be Polyethylene (PE), Polyamide-1 or PVDF and may be reinforced with Aramid or Polyester fibre although other combinations are used.2 More recently the technology of producing such pipe, including the marketing, rests with a few key companies, where it is available in coils up to 400m (1,312ft) length.

Connie Nielsen wrote the second season of The Following.,"Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but qualifies that a moral absolute, like ""Do not kill,"" can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like ""Do not lie"".
Moral absolutism is the ethical view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them.
For example, in Christianity, the greater absolute is judged by how 'much greater' it aligns with the Great Commandments.1
Graded absolutism is a theory of moral absolutism (in Christian ethics) which resolves the objection to absolutism (i.e., in moral conflicts, we are obligated to opposites).
Although 'which' absolutes are in conflict depends on the context, the determination of which 'absolute' is greater is based on objective criteria rather than on the context, which distinguishes graded absolutism from situational ethics.",NOT ENOUGH INFO,1.0
