ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life .

In 1869 , the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot , who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .

It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior .   Horses ' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .   Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament : spirited `` hot bloods '' with speed and endurance ; `` cold bloods '' , such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow , heavy work ; and `` warmbloods '' , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods , often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes , particularly in Europe . There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today , developed for many different uses .   Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits , as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment , and therapy . Horses were historically used in warfare , from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed , using many different styles of equipment and methods of control . Many products are derived from horses , including meat , milk , hide , hair , bone , and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . Humans provide domesticated horses with food , water and shelter , as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers .

Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death .

The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance .

Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers .

Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation − where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment .

Located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean , the city has served as an important port for millennia . , it has a population of 2,425,000 residents .   Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers . These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists , who would go on to establish local aristocracies . During its medieval Golden Age , Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty , a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate . It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities , most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi . The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland ( 1889 -- 1936 ) in the colonial period . After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960 , Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean . After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War , various militias fought for control of the city , later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s . The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups , notably al-Shabaab , which fought the Transitional Federal Government ( 2004 -- 2012 ) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies . With a change in administration in late 2010 , government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011 .

Villa Somalia is the official residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia , Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed . In May 2012 , the First Somali Bank was established in the capital , which organized Mogadishu 's first ever Technology , Entertainment , Design ( TEDx ) conference . The establishment of a local construction yard has also galvanized the city 's real-estate sector . Arba'a Rukun Mosque is one of the oldest Islamic places of worship in the capital , built circa 667 ( 1268/9 AD ) . The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity in Mogadishu is the largest masjid in the Horn region . Mogadishu Cathedral was built in 1928 by the colonial authorities in Italian Somaliland in a Norman Gothic style , and served as the traditional seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio .
