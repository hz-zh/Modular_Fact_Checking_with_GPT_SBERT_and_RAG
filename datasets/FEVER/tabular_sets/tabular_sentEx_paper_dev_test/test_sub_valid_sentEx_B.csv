With an estimated population of around 15.8 million , it is the most populated state in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción , also known as Guatemala City .   The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved in 1841 .   From the mid to late 19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship .   From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability . As of 2014 , Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the Human Development Index .   Guatemala 's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes a large number of endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica 's designation as a biodiversity hotspot . The country is also known for its rich and distinct culture , which is characterized by a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous influences .

In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 . Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries . Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943 . During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign . The Italian population then went into decline . Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951 .   A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I , beginning a period of sweeping social reform . The most prominent coup figure , Muammar Gaddafi , was ultimately able to have power fully concentrated in his hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution , remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011 , fought by those supporting the government and by forces attempting to overthrow it , in which the rebels were supported by NATO .

The Supreme Court in the Libya Dawn and General National Congress-controlled Tripoli declared the Tobruk government unconstitutional in November 2014 , but the body has rejected the ruling as made under threat of violence .   Parts of Libya are outside of either government 's control , with various Islamist , rebel , and tribal militias administering some cities and areas .

It consists of a commercial industry involved in the research and development , engineering , production , and servicing of military material , equipment , and facilities . Arms-producing companies , also referred to as arms dealers , defense contractors , or as the military industry , produce arms for the armed forces of states and civilians . Departments of government also operate in the arms industry , buying and selling weapons , munitions and other military items . An arsenal is a place where arms and ammunition are made , maintained and repaired , stored , or issued , in any combination , whether privately or publicly owned . Products include guns , artillery , ammunition , missiles , military aircraft , military vehicles , ships , electronic systems , night vision devices , holographic weapon sights , laser rangefinders , laser sights , hand grenades , landmines and more . The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support .   Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) estimated in 2012 that 2012 military expenditures were roughly 1.8 trillion United States dollars . This represents a relative decline from 1990 when military expenditures made up 4 % of world GDP . Part of the money goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry . The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms-producing companies amounted to an estimated $ 395 billion in 2012 according to SIPRI . In 2004 over $ 30 billion were spent in the international arms trade ( a figure that excludes domestic sales of arms ) . According to SIPRI , the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010 -- 14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005 -- 2009 . The ﬁve biggest exporters in 2010 -- 2014 were the United States , Russia , China , Germany and France , and the ﬁve biggest importers were India , Saudi Arabia , China , the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan .   Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces . Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens , primarily for self-defense , hunting or sporting purposes . Illegal trade in small arms occurs in many countries and regions affected by political instability . The Small Arms Survey estimates that 875 million small arms circulate worldwide , produced by more than 1,000 companies from nearly 100 countries .   Contracts to supply a given country 's military are awarded by governments , making arms contracts of substantial political importance . The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development of what U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower described as a military-industrial complex , where the armed forces , commerce , and politics become closely linked , similarly to the European multilateral defence procurement . Various corporations , some publicly held , others private , bid for these contracts , which are often worth many billions of dollars . Sometimes , as with the contract for the international Joint Strike Fighter , a competitive tendering process takes place , with the decision made on the merits of the designs submitted by the companies involved . Other times , no bidding or competition takes place . "", 'Efraim Diveroli ( born December 20 , 1985 ) is an American former arms dealer and author .

As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Diveroli was 21 and partner David Packouz was 25 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .

It was also known as Duko, its ruler carrying the title Kië ma-kolano (Ruler of the Mountain). Tidore was a rival of the Sultanate of Ternate for control of the spice trade and had an important historical role as binding the archipelagic civilizations of Indonesia to the Papuan world.2 According to extant historical records, in particular the genealogies of the kings of Ternate and Tidore, the inaugural Tidorese king was Sahjati or Muhammad Naqil whose enthronement is dated 1 in local tradition. However, the accuracy of the tradition that Tidore emerged as a polity as early as the 11th century is considered debatable. Islam was only made the official state religion in the late 15th century through the ninth King of Tidore, Sultan Jamaluddin. He was influenced by the preachings of Syekh Mansur, originally from Arabia.3 In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Sultans tended to ally with either Spain or Portugal to maintain their political role but were finally drawn into the Dutch sphere of power in 1663. Despite a period of anti-colonial rebellion in 1780–1810, the Dutch grip on the sultanate increased until decolonization in the 1940s. Meanwhile, Tidore's suzerainty over Raja Ampat and western Papua was acknowledged by the colonial state.4 In modern times, the sultanate has been revived as a cultural institution.5""]",[]

It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir .

Bogart began acting in 1921 after a hitch in the U.S. Navy in World War I and little success in various jobs in finance and the production side of the theater . Gradually he became a regular in Broadway shows in the 1920s and 1930s . When the stock market crash of 1929 reduced the demand for plays , Bogart turned to film . His first great success was as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest ( 1936 ) , and this led to a period of typecasting as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces ( 1938 ) .   Bogart 's breakthrough as a leading man came in 1941 with High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon .

April 2 ] 1743 -- July 4 , 1826 ) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 . Previously , he was elected the second Vice President of the United States , serving under John Adams from 1797 to 1801 . A proponent of democracy , republicanism , and individual rights motivating American colonists to break from Great Britain and form a new nation , he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level . He was a land owner and farmer .   Jefferson was primarily of English ancestry , born and educated in colonial Virginia . He graduated from the College of William & Mary and briefly practiced law , at times defending slaves seeking their freedom . During the American Revolution , he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration , drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator , and he served as a wartime governor ( 1779 -- 1781 ) . He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785 , and subsequently the nation 's first Secretary of State in 1790 -- 1793 under President George Washington . Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System . With Madison , he anonymously wrote the controversial Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 -- 1799 , which sought to embolden states ' rights in opposition to the national government by nullifying the Alien and Sedition Acts .   As President , Jefferson pursued the nation 's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies . He also organized the Louisiana Purchase , almost doubling the country 's territory . As a result of peace negotiations with France , his administration reduced military forces . He was reelected in 1804 . Jefferson 's second term was beset with difficulties at home , including the trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr . American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act of 1807 , responding to British threats to U.S. shipping . In 1803 , Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized Louisiana Territory , and he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807 .   Jefferson mastered many disciplines , which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics . He was a proven architect in the classical tradition . Jefferson 's keen interest in religion and philosophy earned him the presidency of the American Philosophical Society . He shunned organized religion , but was influenced by both Christianity and deism . He was well versed in linguistics and spoke several languages . He founded the University of Virginia after retiring from public office . He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent and important people throughout his adult life . His only full-length book is Notes on the State of Virginia ( 1785 ) , considered the most important American book published before 1800 .   Jefferson owned several plantations which were worked by hundreds of slaves . Most historians now believe that , after the death of his wife in 1782 , he had a relationship with his slave Sally Hemings and fathered at least one of her children . Historians have lauded Jefferson 's public life , noting his primary authorship of the Declaration of Independence during the Revolutionary War , his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia , and the Louisiana Purchase while he was president . Various modern scholars are more critical of Jefferson 's private life , pointing out the discrepancy between his ownership of slaves and his liberal political principles , for example .

Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common . ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life . The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50 . The average survival from onset to death is two to four years . About 10 % survive longer than 10 years . Most die from respiratory failure . In much of the world , rates of ALS are unknown . In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year .   Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell . In 1869 , the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot , who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking , diagnosed in 1963 and expected to die within two years , became famous . In 2014 , videos of the ice bucket challenge went viral on the World Wide Web and increased public awareness of the condition .
