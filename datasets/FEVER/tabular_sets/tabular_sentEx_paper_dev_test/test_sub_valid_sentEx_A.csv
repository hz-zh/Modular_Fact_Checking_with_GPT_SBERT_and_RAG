It is also known as `` automatic speech recognition '' ( ASR ) , `` computer speech recognition '' , or just `` speech to text '' ( STT ) . It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields .   Some SR systems use `` training '' ( also called `` enrollment '' ) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system . The system analyzes the person 's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person 's speech , resulting in increased accuracy . Systems that do not use training are called `` speaker independent '' systems . Systems that use training are called `` speaker dependent '' .   Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing ( e.g. `` Call home '' ) , call routing ( e.g. `` I would like to make a collect call '' ) , domotic appliance control , search ( e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken ) , simple data entry ( e.g. , entering a credit card number ) , preparation of structured documents ( e.g. a radiology report ) , speech-to-text processing ( e.g. , word processors or emails ) , and aircraft ( usually termed Direct Voice Input ) .   The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker , rather than what they are saying . Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person 's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process .   From the technology perspective , speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations . Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field , but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems . These speech industry players include Google , Microsoft , IBM , Baidu , Apple , Amazon , Nuance , SoundHound , IflyTek , CDAC many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning .

It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . The Quran is divided into chapters ( surah in Arabic ) , which are then divided into verses ( ayah ) .   Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , gradually over a period of approximately 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad . The word `` Quran '' occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran , although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran .   According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .   The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures . It summarizes some , dwells at length on others and , in some cases , presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events . The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events , and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence . The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law . During prayers , the Quran is recited only in Arabic .   Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz . Some Muslims read Quranic ayah ( verse ) with elocution , which is often called tajwid . During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers . In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse , most Muslims rely on the tafsir .

The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koiné Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek .

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher ( of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire ) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 .

With an area of almost 1.8 e6km2 , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa , and is the 16th largest country in the world . Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world .   The largest city and capital , Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya 's six million people . The other large city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya .   Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age . The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya , and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya . Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire . Libya was an early centre of Christianity . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century , when invasions brought Islam and Arab colonisation . In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 . Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries . Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943 . During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign . The Italian population then went into decline . Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951 .   A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I , beginning a period of sweeping social reform . The most prominent coup figure , Muammar Gaddafi , was ultimately able to have power fully concentrated in his hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution , remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011 , fought by those supporting the government and by forces attempting to overthrow it , in which the rebels were supported by NATO . Since then , Libya has experienced a period of instability .

Parts of Libya are outside of either government 's control , with various Islamist , rebel , and tribal militias administering some cities and areas . The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between the Tobruk - and Tripoli-based factions . An agreement to form a unified interim government was signed on 17 December 2015 .

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .

Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .

These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months ; however , this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system .   Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . More than 99 % of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5 % of cases are from dogs . Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies . The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves . The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms .   Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world . Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk . The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common . In people who have been exposed to rabies , the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms . Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water , povidone iodine , or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission . Only five people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms , and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol .   Rabies caused about 17,400 deaths worldwide in 2015 . More than 95 % of human deaths caused by rabies occur in Africa and Asia . About 40 % of deaths occur in children under the age of 15 . Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica . More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs . A number of countries , including Australia and Japan , as well as much of Western Europe , do not have rabies among dogs . Many small island nations do not have rabies at all .

The best known building was Spuistraat 199, known as the Slangenpand (Snakehouse) because of the large mural which covered the front exterior. In 2015, the squatters were evicted and the buildings were mostly demolished prior to redevelopment. The new project is known as De Keizer and has 6 apartments, a restaurant and a gallery. Two of the buildings are registered as rijksmonumenten (national monuments).']","['Dreamer', 'American']"

By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million . In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions . The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition . Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition . As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .   Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller . Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .
