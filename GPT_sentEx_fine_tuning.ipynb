Featuring an ensemble cast , the film stars Vanessa L. Williams , Vivica A. Fox , Nia Long , Michael Beach , Mekhi Phifer , Jeffrey D. Sams , Irma P. Hall , Gina Ravera and Brandon Hammond . Written and directed by George Tillman , Jr. -- in his major studio debut -- the film centers on the trials of an extended African-American family , held together by longstanding family traditions which begin to fade as serious problems take center stage .   Tillman based the family in the film on his own and Soul Food was widely acclaimed for presenting a more positive image of African-Americans than is typically seen in Hollywood films . In 2000 , Showtime premiered a one-hour television series based upon the film .
