Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch . \n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 2.3.3:\n","\tNumber of retrieved sentences on iteration 1: 1\n","\tNew sentences: ['He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland.']\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 2.4.1:\n","\tClaim: James VI and I was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland.\n","\tSentence: He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland.\n","\tCosine Similarity: 0.8981462390204987\n","\tROUGE-1 F1-score: 0.8275862068965517\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","\tAdded sentence to filtered sentences: He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland.\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 2.4.2:\n","\tAdded 1 new sentences on iteration 1.\n","\tTotal extracted sentences: 2\n","\tExtracted sentences: ['He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland.', 'He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland.']\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","Reached the end of the loop, iteration: 1\n","#-------------------------------------------------------------#\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r 37%|███▋      | 13/35 [00:44<00:59,  2.69s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["DEBUG 3.2.1:\n","\tClassification result: SUPPORTS\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 3.3.1:\n","\tExit status: OK\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","-------------------------------------------------------------\n","DEBUG 3.4.1:\n","\tClassification result: SUPPORTS\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 1.1.1:\n","Evidence items: [['The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference .', 'New_York_Knicks', 1, ['Atlantic', 'Eastern Conference (NBA)', 'National Basketball Association', 'Eastern', 'Atlantic Division', 'Eastern Conference', 'Atlantic Division (NBA)']], ['Beginning in 1950 , the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals , all of which were losing efforts .', 'New_York_Knicks', 9, ['NBA Finals']]]\n","DEBUG 1.1.2:\n","\tEvidence item: ['The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference .', 'New_York_Knicks', 1, ['Atlantic', 'Eastern Conference (NBA)', 'National Basketball Association', 'Eastern', 'Atlantic Division', 'Eastern Conference', 'Atlantic Division (NBA)']]\n","\tEntities: ['Atlantic', 'Eastern Conference (NBA)', 'National Basketball Association', 'Eastern', 'Atlantic Division', 'Eastern Conference', 'Atlantic Division (NBA)']\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 1.1.2:\n","\tEvidence item: ['Beginning in 1950 , the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals , all of which were losing efforts .', 'New_York_Knicks', 9, ['NBA Finals']]\n","\tEntities: ['NBA Finals']\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 2.1.1:\n","\tNumber of documents: 2\n","\tMax iterations: 2\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 2.1.2:\n","\tClaim: The New York Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n","\tEntities: Eastern, Eastern Conference (NBA), Atlantic Division, Eastern Conference, Atlantic, Atlantic Division (NBA), NBA Finals, National Basketball Association\n","\tKeywords: ['knicks', 'national', 'nba', 'new', 'york']\n","-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n","DEBUG 2.3.1:\n","\tFiltered text: The New York Knickerbockers , commonly referred to as the Knicks , are an American professional basketball team based in New York City .

In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing . The regime , headed by Augusto Pinochet , ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010 .   Chile is today one of South America 's most stable and prosperous nations . It leads Latin American nations in rankings of human development , competitiveness , income per capita , globalization , state of peace , economic freedom , and low perception of corruption . It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state , and democratic development . Chile is a founding member of the United Nations , the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) .
