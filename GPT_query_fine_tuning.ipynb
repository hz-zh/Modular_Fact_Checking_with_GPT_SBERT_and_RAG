Featuring an ensemble cast , the film stars Vanessa L. Williams , Vivica A. Fox , Nia Long , Michael Beach , Mekhi Phifer , Jeffrey D. Sams , Irma P. Hall , Gina Ravera and Brandon Hammond . Written and directed by George Tillman , Jr. -- in his major studio debut -- the film centers on the trials of an extended African-American family , held together by longstanding family traditions which begin to fade as serious problems take center stage .   Tillman based the family in the film on his own and Soul Food was widely acclaimed for presenting a more positive image of African-Americans than is typically seen in Hollywood films . In 2000 , Showtime premiered a one-hour television series based upon the film . In 2015 , it was announced that 20th Century Fox is planning a sequel for film called More Soul Food , written by Tillman , Jr. . \"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Soul Food is a 1997 American comedy-drama film produced by Kenneth `` Babyface '' Edmonds , Tracey Edmonds and Robert Teitel and released by Fox 2000 Pictures .\"}]}\n","\"\"\"\n","train_data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"datasets/FEVER/tabular_sets/tabular_sentEx_paper_dev_train/v1_segmented_sentIDs_n3461_04-04_002.csv\"))\n","valid_data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"datasets/FEVER/tabular_sets/tabular_sentEx_paper_dev_valid/v1_segmented_sentIDs_n1482_04-04_002.csv\"))\n","# Format dataset for chat-based fine-tuning for page title prediction.\n","def prepare_chat_finetuning_data(df):\n","    formatted_data = []\n","    supports = 0\n","    refutes = 0\n","    nei = 0\n","\n","    bracket_mapping = {\n","        \"-LRB-\": \"(\",\n","        \"-RRB-\": \")\",\n","        \"-LSB-\": \"[\",\n","        \"-RSB-\": \"]\",\n","        \"-LCB-\": \"{\",\n","        \"-RCB-\": \"}\"\n","    }\n","\n","    for _, row in df.iterrows():\n","      print(f\"On row {row['id']}\")\n","      print(f\"Label: {row['label']}\")\n","\n","      page_titles = []\n","      claim = row['claim']\n","      print(row['evidence_items'])\n","      #print(claim)\n","      if row['label'] == 'NOT ENOUGH INFO': # We don't need NEI (negative) samples for page title relationship modeling\n","          continue\n","      elif row['label'] == 'SUPPORTS':\n","          evidence_items = row['evidence_items']\n","          evidence_items = ast.literal_eval(evidence_items)\n","          print(evidence_items)\n","          if supports < 100:\n","            for item in evidence_items: # item is a list, we want the second element (the page title)\n","                mapped_text = item[1]\n","                for key, value in bracket_mapping.items():\n","                    mapped_text = mapped_text.replace(key, value)\n","                page_titles.append(f\"'{mapped_text}'\")\n","\n","            # Drop duplicate page titles (we only need GPT_query to suggest the page, not necessarily how many sentences were extracted from that page, which is what the repeated page titles indicate).\n","            page_titles = list(set(page_titles))\n","\n","            formatted_data.append({\n","                \"messages\": [\n","                    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that identifies relevant Wikipedia page titles based on a claim.\"},\n","                    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Given the claim '{claim}', list the most relevant Wikipedia page titles likely to contain evidence.
